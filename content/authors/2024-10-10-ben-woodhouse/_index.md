I am currently pursuing an MPhil in Biomedical Science at Keele University, focusing on an in vitro investigation of novel regenerative approaches for hip cartilage repair within the OsKOR research group. Under the mentorship of Mr. Geraint Thomas and Professor Karina Wright, my project analyses the viability of a routinely discarded cell source from patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome.
I completed my BSc in Biomedical Science at Cardiff University. My undergraduate education provided a solid foundation in cell therapies and regenerative medicine, particularly through an in-depth module on the musculoskeletal system. This module allowed me to explore muscle, tendon, and bone structures, their pathologies, and reparative techniques such as tissue engineering. Additionally, I conducted a research project on the "Association of Testosterone Levels with Performance in Female Athletes," which enhanced my skills in data analysis and scientific communication. I am passionate about leveraging innovative approaches in tissue engineering to improve patient care and treatment outcomes.
