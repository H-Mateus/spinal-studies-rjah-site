I am a current PhD student working at [Keele University](https://www.keele.ac.uk/) and [The Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital](https://www.rjah.nhs.uk/). My PhD protect is titled "Transcriptomic, proteomic and Bioinformatics Analyses of Cell-Based Therapies for Cartilage Injuries in Humans". I will be performing a bioinformatics analysis on transcriptomic and proteomic data obtained from cells in the autologous stem cell, chondrocyte or the two (ASCOT) clinical trial. I aim to identify a set of genes and proteins which are differentially expressed between the different treatment groups in the ASCOT trial which can highlight specific biological pathways involved. That way I can hope to understand the mechanisms responsible for the effects of each transplanted cell population, and ultimately identify a molecular profile(s) that can help predict clinical efficacy.

Prior to my PhD I completed a BSc in Biomedical Science and an MSc in Biomedical Engineering, both at Keele University. I have also worked in a GMP Facility for over 2 years as an Experienced Upstream Scientist focused on Mammalian cells.
