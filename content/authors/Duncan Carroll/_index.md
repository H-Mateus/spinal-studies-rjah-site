I am currently studying BSc Biomedical Sciences at Cardiff University, and this academic year
I’m on my professional training year at the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital.

The professional training year allows me to be trained in tissue culture, flow cytometry and
other lab techniques for my degree, as well as undertaking a research project in the lab. My
research project involves finding the best clinically relevant technique for seeding collagen
scaffolds with cells for surgical implantation in cartilage defects, and assessing seeded
scaffolds for cell viability. As well as the scaffold project I am also involved in Tim’s
synovium-on-a-chip project by isolating cells from waste synovium and cartilage, collecting and
organising data, and scoring synovium histological samples.
