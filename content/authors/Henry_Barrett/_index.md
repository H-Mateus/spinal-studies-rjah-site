I am a first year PhD student with Keele university. I am based at the Robert Jones and Agnes
Hunt Orthopaedic hospital, Oswestry. My project aims to compare Treg-derived extracellular
vesicles (EV) from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients to healthy donors.

Current Treatments for autoimmune disorders like RA can be poorly tolerated, ineffective, and
lead to the development of opportunistic infections. Comparing the different immuno-suppressive
efficacies of healthy and RA EVs will allow us to explore their therapeutic potential and guide
our approach to manufacturing for clinical use. Additionally, identifying differentially
expressed vesicular factors could help improve our understanding of the mechanisms that underpin
RA, potentially leading to improved diagnostics and tailoring of treatment regimes.
