Hi, I’m Hollie a first year PhD student in the school of pharmacy and bioengineering at [The University of Keele](https://www.keele.ac.uk/). My research project is titled: ‘Artificial
intelligence and genomic sequencing in the diagnosis of orthopaedic infection’. I will be using
a sequencing device called the minion to sequence bacteria DNA extracted from samples of
patients who are suspected to have infection due to prosthetic joint implantation. I also hope
to be able to identify resistance genes in these bacteria to guide the use of antibiotics in the
clinic.

 I completed my undergraduate degree at The University of Exeter and then my Masters in genomic
 medicine at The University of Manchester. It was during my undergraduate degree I discovered my
 love of genetics and how we can apply our knowledge in the clinical setting. I think the new
 ways we apply genetics to improve patient care and develop treatments will continue to improve
 the way we treat patients in the future.
