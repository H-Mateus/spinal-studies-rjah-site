I am a Cardiff University student, on a placement year at Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital in Oswestry.

My research project is currently based on proteomic analysis of biomarkers with the aim of identifying biomarkers for prognostic outlook of patients.

I am evaluating the pathways and key regulatory molecules that are consistent across non-responders to stratify patients, identify therapeutic targets and improve patient outcome. Additionally, I will be assessing if there are sufficient similarities between the KICK Kennedy Trust for Rheumatology Research cohort and ACI cohort to allow the 1st stage ACIâ€™s surgical acute knee injury to model the KICK cohorts post-traumatic acute knee injury.
