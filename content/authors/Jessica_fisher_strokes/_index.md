I am a first year PhD student working at [The Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital in Oswestry](https://www.rjah.nhs.uk/).

My research project, started in January 2022, is “An Investigation into the Identification, Validation and Biological Understanding of Biomarkers Post-Spinal Cord Injury” and is aimed at identifying and developing a prognostic biomarker panel for spinal cord injury.

Before undertaking my PhD, I studied at [The University of Chester](https://www1.chester.ac.uk/) and gained both a BSc in Biomedical Science and an MRes in Medical Science with Orthopaedics.
