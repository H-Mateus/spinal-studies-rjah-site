I am a first year PhD student at Keele University, in the Osteoarthritis Research group based at The Robert Jones
and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital, Oswestry. My research project utilizes cryopreservation and logistical
characterisation, to support the implementation and uptake of the osteochondral allograft therapy for cartilage
repair. This advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP) is widely used in countries such as the US and offers hope
for patients who otherwise would not be suitable for standard procedures. <br><br> I completed my undergraduate
degree and master’s degree at The University of Keele, in the School of Life Sciences and The School of Pharmacy and
Bioengineering respectively. During my undergraduate study I realized my passion for human biology and medicine,
although it wasn’t until my postgraduate study that I discovered how my passion could be intertwined with research
in a translative setting to further medical therapeutics. I believe that tissue engineering and regenerative
medicine are modern fields that can provide novel improvements to patient care and treatment now and for the future.
