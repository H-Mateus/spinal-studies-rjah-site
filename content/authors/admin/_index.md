I am currently a Research Associate at [Cardiff Univeristy](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/), working as a bioinformatician at the Cardiff Dementia Research Institute on Alzheimer's disease.

I undertook my PhD at [Keele Univeristy](https://www.keele.ac.uk/research/) funded by the [EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org/) as part of the [Center for Doctoral Training in Regenerative Medicine](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/microsites/chemical/dtcregen-med/) whilst a part of OsKOR.

My research at OsKOR focused on the prognosis of spinal cord injury.
I had been investigating the value of blood parameters measured as part of routine care in predicting the level of neurological recovery a patient may have.
I also utilised proteomic techniques and ELISAs to further analyse patient blood to identify potential novel biomarkers that may predict recovery.
Some of our work has identified the liver as potentially being implicated in neurological recovery following SCI, so future work in the group will follow this line of inquiry as well.

I graduated from the [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/) in with a BSc in biological sciences in 2016.
Upon completing my degree I obtained an internship at the [Bionics institute](http://www.bionicsinstitute.org/) in Melbourne, Australia.
In my time there I gained valuable research experience at a biomedical research institute working with an internationally renowned research team on gene therapy and optogenetics in the cochlea.

During my PhD I developed a new-found love of data science, reproducible research and a passion for programming in R and Python.

I also made this website!
