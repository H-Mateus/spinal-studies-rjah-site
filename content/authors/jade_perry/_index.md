I am a Research Associate based at [the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital](https://www.rjah.nhs.uk/). I completed my PhD, titled, ‘Human cell therapies in preclinical and clinical studies of cartilage repair’ under Professor Sally Roberts in June 2020. Currently, I am funded on a [Medical Research Council](https://www.ukri.org/councils/mrc/) Biomedical catalyst (DPFS) grant which aims to manufacture and implant an allogeneic chondrocyte progenitor advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP) for cartilage repair in a phase II trial.

Additionally, I am also funded by a [Versus Arthritis](https://www.versusarthritis.org/) grant which aims to determine whether local infection causes disc degeneration with Modic type 1 change (The Microbiome Study).
