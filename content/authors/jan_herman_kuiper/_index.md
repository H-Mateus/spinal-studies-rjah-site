I trained as a mechanical engineer at [The University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/) and received a PhD in Medical Sciences from [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/english/) Nijmegen, both in the Netherlands. In 2001, I was appointed as lecturer at Keele, where I teach Biomechanics and Applied Statistics for Postgraduates. 

My research focuses on skeletal tissue healing and orthopaedic procedures, and has led to a wide range of peer-reviewed publications. It is truly interdisciplinary research, in which I collaborate with clinicians, biologists, engineers, chemists and mathematicians. To do this research, I have attracted funding from Research Councils, charities and industry, most recently from the MRC. Much of the research takes place at [The Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital](https://www.rjah.nhs.uk/) in Oswestry.
