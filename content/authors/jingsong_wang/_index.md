I was awarded a MD in Clinical Medicine from Dalian Medical University in 2016.
I got an PhD offer from Keele University in Cell and Tissue Engineering in 2017.
Since then I started my research work as a PhD student at the RJAH and currently in my final year of PhD.

My research interests are meniscus injuries, focusing on:

-   Understanding meniscus degeneration
-   Enhancing meniscus tissue repair
-   Developing cell-based meniscus therapies

Beyond the lab work, I am also a big basketball fan.
One of the reason I looked into meniscus repair is I injured my own meniscus twice while playing basketball.
Now I am trying to cure myself!
