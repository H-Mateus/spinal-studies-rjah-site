I commenced my studies at the RJAH Orthopaedic Hospital Foundation Trust in 2005, and in 2009, was awarded a PhD in Biomedical Engineering from Keele University.
Since then I have been employed as an academic researcher and senior lecturer at the RJAH/Keele and am also the current Keele’s stakeholder governor for the hospital.

My groups research interests are musculoskeletal injuries/diseases, spinal cord injuries and pressure sores, focussing on:

-   Understanding their biology and pathology
-   Improving their diagnosis and prognosis
-   Developing and delivering cell-based therapies
