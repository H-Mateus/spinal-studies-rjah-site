I am a current PhD student at [Keele University](https://www.keele.ac.uk/) and [The Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital in Oswestry](https://www.rjah.nhs.uk/).

My research investigates into patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS); improving the diagnostics, prognostics and cell based therapies.

To improve current understanding of the underlying biology of PFPS, I aim to characterise a range of PFPS patients at differing disease stage pathogenesis using knee function assessments, clinical imaging modalities, synovial fluid proteomics, targeted biomarker assessments, and cellular analysis.
To improve and develop new PFPS cell-based therapies, I am to assess the current clinical outcomes of patients who have undergone autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) treatment within the patellofemoral joint, and to develop a biocompatible scaffold with the aim to evaluate the success of regenerating cartilage growth on the patella.

Prior to undertaking my PhD, I graduated from Manchester Metropolitan University with a 1st class MBioMedSci (Hons) Biomedical Science degree.
During my degree, I deferred my studies in order to undertake a years placement at AstraZeneca as a Microbiologist.
Upon completion of my degree, I worked as a senior laboratory technician.
By having a variety of industry experience, I believe it has given me valuable skills of which I can incorporate into my PhD research.

Having suffered from lifelong patellofemoral joint issues, I understand what it feels like to be the patient with very little successful treatment options. Thus, this research is a personally invested area of interest to me.
