I am a PhD student working at both Keele University and [The Robert hunt and Agnes Jones Orthopaedic hospital in Oswestry](https://www.rjah.nhs.uk/).

PhD project: Transcriptome analysis of stem cell and chondrocyte therapies.

I commenced work on this project in January 2019. During the course of this research project I will be investigating the transcriptome profiles (generated via RNA sequencing technologies) of the cells used in the autologous stem cell, chondrocyte or the two (ASCOT) clinical trial. From there, I will explore what genes are expressed in these cells and whether there is a link between gene expression profiles and patient outcome 15 months following intervention.

Prior to starting this PhD, I obtained a BSc in Biomedical Science from Keele University and was employed at a Genetic Toxicology contract research organisation during and after finishing my degree. Previous to that, I completed a modern apprenticeship at AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals working within Genetic Toxicology, Hepatic Toxicology and Cardiac Toxicology departments.
