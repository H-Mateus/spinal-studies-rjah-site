I am a 2nd year PhD student based at [RJAH, Oswestry](https://www.rjah.nhs.uk/).
My research involves studying the immunomodulatory potential of extracellular vesicles derived from umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells.
My aim is to study the characteristics of these extracelullar vesicles and see if they have anti-inflammatory properties for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis.

I am collaborating with some researchers from the University of Cardiff to analyse the cargo of my extracellular vesicles and their isolation.
