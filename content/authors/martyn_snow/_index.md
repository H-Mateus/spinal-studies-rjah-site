I am a consultant knee and shoulder surgeon at [The Royal Orthopaedic Hospital](https://www.roh.nhs.uk/) in Birmingham and now [The RJAH Orthopaedic Hospital](https://www.rjah.nhs.uk/) in Oswestry, which are 2 of only 5 purely Orthopaedic Hospitals in the country.

I graduated from [Edinburgh University](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) and undertook Registrar training in the Manchester region. After completion of UK training I spent 18 months on fellowship in North America. I spent 12 months in Halifax, Nova Scotia, undertaking a Sports Medicine fellowship at [The Sports Medicine Clinic](https://www.arthritisandinjurycare.com/sport-medicine-halifax/) of Nova Scotia and subsequently spent 6 months at [The Holland Orthopaedic and Arthritic Centre](https://https://sunnybrook.ca/) in Toronto, gaining further experience in Shoulder and Knee surgery. 

In 2008 I was awarded the British Elbow and Shoulder Society North American traveling fellowship, visiting some of the world’s foremost shoulder surgeons in major centres such as New York, Los Angeles, San Antonio and Houston. In 2018 I was awarded the European Society of Sports Traumatology Knee surgery and Arthroscopy APKASS travelling fellowship visiting centres in Sydney, Melbourne, Singapore, Hong Kong and Thailand. 

I am an invited faculty member on courses and meetings across the globe, teaching surgeons the latest techniques in arthroscopic surgery. I have over 70 scientific publications in various international medical journals and have written 6 book chapters on knee and shoulder injuries. I have presented over 100 papers and my current grant awards are in excess of £3M. 

I have particular expertise in cartilage repair and am a committee member of the International Cartilage Repair Society. I treat all aspects of cartilage injuries using the full spectrum of cartilage regeneration techniques including Osteochondral Allograft and Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation.

Recently I was awarded a £2.4M MRC DPFS grant to develop (with myself and others in Oswestry) a new off-the-shelf chondrocyte therapy, which will be delivered across 3 specialist centres in a phaseI/II trial, due to commence in 2023.
