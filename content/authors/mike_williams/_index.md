Reporting to Prof Sally Roberts, I am responsible for the maintenance and development of the OsCell Research Database and for the extraction, manipulation and presentation of data to the research team as required. I also carry out other ad hoc data analysis work, and input of patient data related to the ASCOT and REACT studies.
