I am currently employed at the [Robert Jones & Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital](https://www.rjah.nhs.uk/) in Oswestry as a Consenting Research Officer.
Within this role I am the main interface between Keele Researchers (based at the RJAH), hospital clinicians and clinic staff, and importantly the patients attending pre-operative clinics at the hospital.

I studied for my PhD at the RJAH and have subsequently worked there for many years as a post-doctoral researcher.
I have a keen interest in bone health and disease and the preservation of cartilage.
I have previous experience in the development and application of novel markers of bone resorption and clinical research studies investigating skeletal health in the ageing population.
