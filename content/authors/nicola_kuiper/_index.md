I am a highly qualified academic with a biomedical PhD (awarded 1994) and a long-standing career in the musculoskeletal biology field via a long association with the Robert Jones & Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic NHS Hospital.

Over a 30-year academic career, my research covered the biology of cartilage and bones, how injured cartilage heals and the development of new strategies to help patients with damaged or diseased joints, contributing to well-established regenerative medicine enabling technologies via awards from charity, industry, and Research Councils UK.

Over a concurrent 20-year higher education teaching career, as a key member of the small team who set up Keele University Medical School in 2003, I have innovated biomedical sciences assessment, teaching, and learning in the school. I held senior educational roles including Year Lead and Assessment Lead, as well as external advisory roles.

In 2018, I experienced a life-threatening illness which led to a significant career break. In 2023, I was awarded a retraining research fellowship co-sponsored by the Daphne Jackson Trust, Orthopaedic Research UK and the Medical Research Council. My research focuses on analysing health data on patients with knee cartilage problems, to find out the period of time from knee surgery to total joint replacement. I aim to help clinicians predict when and to whom cartilage repair may be successfully applied by developing an algorithm and ultimately a digital app to be used in outpatient clinics.
