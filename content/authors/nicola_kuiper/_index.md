I have a biomedical PhD (awarded 1995), enriched with a high-level of experience in musculoskeletal biology research via academia and a long association with the Arthritis Research Centre at the Robert Jones & Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic NHS Hospital. Oswestry. In 2003, I joined Keele Medical School as a new Lecturer. In 2008, I was promoted to Senior Lecturer. With awards from charity, industry, and Research Councils UK, m research covered the biology of cartilage and bones, how injured cartilage heals and the development of new strategies to help patients with damaged or diseased joints. I have contributed to well-established regenerative medicine enabling technologies.

In 2018, I experienced a life-threatening illness which led to a significant career break. A slow recovery coincided with the Covid pandemic and, now in good health, I have decided to seek a new career path. In 2023, I was awarded a retraining senior research fellowship co-sponsored by the Daphne Jackson Trust, Orthopaedic Research UK and the Medical Research Council. https://oruk.org/inaugural-winner-of-the-oruk-daphne-jackson-fellowship/

My research focuses on analysing health data on patients with knee cartilage problems, to find out the period of time from knee surgery to total joint replacement. I aim to help clinicians predict when and to whom cartilage repair may be successfully applied by developing an algorithm and ultimately a digital app to be used in outpatient clinics.
