-   What you are working on?

I started work here doing my PhD on Articular Cartilage and its role in Osteoarthritis and have come full circle to mostly working on that again now! I currently spend most time working with people doing studies with others related to cell therapy for cartilage repair eg Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation and developing other approaches for the future.

-   Areas of interest/collaborations

Previously worked extensively on the spine, intervertebral discs and back pain, particularly the basic science (cell biology, matrix components and organisation) of the disc in health and disease.
