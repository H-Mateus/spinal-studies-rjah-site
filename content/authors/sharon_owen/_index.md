I work as a Research Technician within the OsKOR group reporting to Dr Karina Wright and providing
technical support for the acquisition and processing of human tissues for multiple projects. Although
this role is based at the RJAH Orthopaedic Hospital, it is also linked to the Birmingham Biomedical
Research Centre.<br><br> I returned to education after starting a family and obtained a BSc in
Biochemistry from Liverpool University. In 1997, I embarked on a PhD based in the Charles Salt Centre at
the RJAH under the supervision of Dr Christopher Sharp investigating the biomechanical and biochemical
properties of osteoarthritic bone.<br><br> Following completion of my PhD and further additions to my
family, I returned to the RJAH in 2004 and started working on a project investigating the stress
response of cells from the intervertebral disc (Grammer and European Spine Journal Award, 2010). Since
2010 I have been involved in various projects with Professor Sally Roberts and Dr Karina Wright.
Primarily, these projects involved tissues and cells from the intervertebral disc but also included 
investigations into the purity of commercially prepared proteoglycans and the potential of blood
biomarkers to predict neurological outcome in spinal cord injury patients. In 2014, I was awarded a
Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Travelling Fellowship to investigate the integration of intervertebral
disc tissue at the vertebral interface of human lumbar spines. <br><br> At the end of 2018, I started
working with Dr Heidi Fuller on a GOSH and SPARKS funded project investigating the proteomic profile of
cells from different clinical severities of Spinal Muscular Atrophy patients. The aim of this work was
to identify molecular differences between the different clinical types and to utilise these differences
for more targeted treatment and/or as biomarkers to monitor treatment strategies.
