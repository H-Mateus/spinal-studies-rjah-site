I am a current Bsc Biomedical sciences student in Cardiff university and I am on my professional training year at the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt hospital for the year 2023/24. 

The professional training year will allow me to learn necessary skills such as tissue culture,
flow cytometry, PCR and other laboratory techniques which would help me in the long term. My
research project is based on identifying biomarkers for prognostic outlook of patients and I also
will be helping with Tims organ on a chip project by isolating cells from human cartilage and
synovium and scoring histology samples.
