The FLUOstar® Omega is a multi-mode microplate reader with six detection modes:

  -   Fluorescence intensity (including FRET), 
  -   Luminescence (including BRET), 
  -   UV/vis absorbance, 
  -   Time-resolved fluorescence, 
  -   TR-FRET, 
  -   AlphaScreen®/AlphaLISA®.
  
It utilizes an ultra-fast UV/vis spectrometer or filters for absorbance as well as
highly sensitive filters for all other detection modes. The LVis Plate is suitable for
quick and easy low-volume concentration measurements of up to 16 DNA, RNA, protein
samples, or spectral scanning. The Atmospheric Control Unit (ACU) enables live
cell-based applications, from standard proliferation to hypoxic or cytotoxicity assays
by independently regulating both O2 and CO2 gas levels within the microplate reader
chamber.

It was funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE).
