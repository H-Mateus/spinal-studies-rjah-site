<p>In April, 11 members of <a href="https://www.rjah.nhs.uk/">RJAH Orthopaedic hospital</a>, inclusive of surgeons and researchers, attended the <a href="https://cartilage.org/event/icrs-2021-16th-world-congress-2/">ICRS world congress conference</a> in the
bustling city of Berlin, Germany. The meeting offered an opportunity to listen to
thought provoking talks varying from surgery techniques, current and emerging cell
therapies, to industry talks and application of products. Armed with 7 talks and 8
posters between us, we showcased some of our outstanding research to members of the
conference and were met with positive, encouraging responses. A very proud moment of
the conference was witnessing one of the special members of our team, Professor Sally
Roberts, achieving the lifetime recognition award. As well as Dr Timothy Hopkins
awarded a poster prize for his research ‘initial development of a synovial joint on a
chip model’. Alongside the conference, there were many social events and networking
opportunities to get involved in, including a next generation ‘happy hour’, in which
new scientists and experienced minds came together to gain new knowledge and
partnerships. Whilst not forgetting to put a little time aside to explore the
historical sights of Berlin.</p>
