The research group works in 3 main clinical areas treating patients with either joint injury or degeneration such as osteoarthritis, inflammatory arthritis or those with spinal problems in the [Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital](https://www.rjah.nhs.uk/), Oswestry.
Two departments here address problems in the spine: the [Centre for Spinal Disorders](https://www.rjah.nhs.uk/Our-Services/Spinal-Disorders-Unit.aspx) (including back pain and spinal deformities) and the [Midlands Centre for Spinal Injuries](https://www.rjah.nhs.uk/Our-Services/Spinal-Injuries-Unit.aspx).

Funding has been from many sources, including [MRC](https://mrc.ukri.org/), [EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org/funding/), [BBSRC](https://bbsrc.ukri.org/), [EU](https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/funding/funding-opportunities_en), the [Oswestry Institute of Orthopaedics](https://www.orthopaedic-institute.org/), the [RJAH Hospital Charitable Fund](https://www.rjah.nhs.uk/charity.aspx) and several Medical Research Charities including [Versus Arthritis](https://www.versusarthritis.org/).
