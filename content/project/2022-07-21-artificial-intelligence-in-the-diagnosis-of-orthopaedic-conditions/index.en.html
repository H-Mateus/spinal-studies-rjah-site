<p><strong>PhD project</strong>:“Artificial Intelligence in the diagnosis of orthopaedic conditions”</p>
<p>Applications closed</p>
<p>Supervisors: Dr Karina Wright and Dr Paul Cool</p>
<p>The aim of this PhD prpject is o investigate the possibility of using nanopore DNA sequencing technology for the real time identification of pathogens in infected arthroplasty, including antimicrobial resistance.</p>
<p>With the lack of a gold standard for identifying infected arthroplasty, comparison will be made with results from frozen section histology, microbiological cultures, clinical details and results from laboratory tests (CRP, ESR, WCC etc).</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence models will be tested on the frozen section histology slides to compare with clinical results to investigate if more accurate predictions can be made on frozen section histology.</p>
