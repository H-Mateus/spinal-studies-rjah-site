The Agilent 4150 TapeStation System is a unique all-in-one platform that includes instrumentation, data processing software, and reagents for the analysis of quantity and integrity of DNA and RNA by proprietary small-scale gel electrophoresis. The system is fully automated, using only 1-2ul sample per run and can analyse up to 16 samples at once with results available in under 20 minutes. The Tapestation provides reliable and reproducible quality control data such as Integrity standards for RNA (RNA integrity number equivalent, RINe) and genomic DNA (DNA Integrity Number, DIN) required for downstream analyses such as next-generation sequencing.
