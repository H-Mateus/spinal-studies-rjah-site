<p>The FLUOstar® Omega is a multi-mode microplate reader with six detection modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fluorescence intensity (including FRET),</li>
<li>Luminescence (including BRET),</li>
<li>UV/vis absorbance,</li>
<li>Time-resolved fluorescence,</li>
<li>TR-FRET,</li>
<li>AlphaScreen®/AlphaLISA®.</li>
</ul>
<p>It utilizes an ultra-fast UV/vis spectrometer or filters for absorbance as well as
highly sensitive filters for all other detection modes. The LVis Plate is suitable for
quick and easy low-volume concentration measurements of up to 16 DNA, RNA, protein
samples, or spectral scanning. The Atmospheric Control Unit (ACU) enables live
cell-based applications, from standard proliferation to hypoxic or cytotoxicity assays
by independently regulating both O2 and CO2 gas levels within the microplate reader
chamber.</p>
<p>It was funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE).</p>
