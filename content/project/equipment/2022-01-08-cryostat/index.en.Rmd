Our brand new Epredia™ HM525 NX cryostat is a high-performance routine cryostat with intuitive software and touchscreen for simple, efficient operation with a user-friendly and ergonomic design. The cryochamber cools to -35°C and features 27 cooled specimen positions, including four fast-freeze stations (cooled to -60°C) to keep up with heavy workloads. A reliable stepping motor technology delivers reproducible section thickness, ranging from 1µm to 500µm. It includes a UV disinfection mode to protect against occupational exposure to biological pathogens and surface contamination.

It was funded by the Orthopaedic Institute.
