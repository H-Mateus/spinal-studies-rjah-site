On the 7th and 8th of June 2022 the 12th Oswestry/Keele Cartilage Symposium was held at Keele
Hall, organised by Dr Helen McCarthy, Dr Karina Wright, Prof Martyn Snow, Prof Sally Roberts,
and Mr Paul Jermin.

The international symposium gathered surgeons and scientists from the UK, Ireland, Germany,
Switzerland, and USA to talk about the latest research and clinical updates in terms of
treatments, biomarkers next generation biological repair and rehabilitation. 
During these two days, speakers focus on “Influencing factors in cartilage repair outcomes”,
“Current trends in cartilage repair”, “Next generation biological repair”, “Pain in
Osteoarthritis”, and “Biomarkers for monitoring knee diseases and treatments”

Abstracts:

  -   Dr Jan Herman Kuiper – ACTIVE, a multicentre RCT of ACI versus other surgical interventions for cartilage defects: five-year results”
  -   Mr Paul Jermin – Autologous blood products with or without platelets
  -   Dr Karina Wright – Proteomic characterization of response to ACI
  -   Dr Bernhard Tins – Imaging as a biomarker


An early career session was also organised to allow PhD student and post-docs to introduce their projects to experts in the field.

Abstracts:

  -   Rebecca Davies – Umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles match, and perhaps surpass, their parental cell’s ability to treat inflammatory arthritis
  -   Tian Lan – Characterisation of mesenchymal stromal cells isolated from autologous bone marrow aspirate concentrates used clinically in the treatment of cartilage defects in the ankle
  -   Anaïs Makos – Predicting patients’ response to TNF inhibitors using potential blood biomarkers in Psoriatic Arthritis


Congratulations to Dr Mahid Ahmed (Newcastle) who won the early career presentation award with “A bioprinted high-throughput human 3D osteochondral model for osteoarthritis research”
