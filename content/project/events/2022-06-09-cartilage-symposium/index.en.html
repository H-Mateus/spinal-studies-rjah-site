<p>On the 7th and 8th of June 2022 the 12th Oswestry/Keele Cartilage Symposium was held at Keele
Hall, organised by Dr Helen McCarthy, Dr Karina Wright, Prof Martyn Snow, Prof Sally Roberts,
and Mr Paul Jermin.</p>
<p>The international symposium gathered surgeons and scientists from the UK, Ireland, Germany,
Switzerland, and USA to talk about the latest research and clinical updates in terms of
treatments, biomarkers next generation biological repair and rehabilitation.
During these two days, speakers focus on “Influencing factors in cartilage repair outcomes”,
“Current trends in cartilage repair”, “Next generation biological repair”, “Pain in
Osteoarthritis”, and “Biomarkers for monitoring knee diseases and treatments”</p>
