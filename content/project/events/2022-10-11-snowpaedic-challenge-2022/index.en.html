<p>On Saturday the 10th of September 2022, our research team participated to the annual Snowpaedic challenge, a sponsored walk organized by the Orthopaedic Institute Charity to support research and education at the RJAH Orthopaedic Hospital.</p>
<p>This year, the Orthopaedic Institute Charity raised fund to support a research study into the Charcot-Marie-Tooth(CMT) disease, a hereditary motor and sensitive neuropathy of the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS). The disease is characterized by progressive loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation across diverse parts of the body.</p>
<p>The Orthopaedic Institute Charity has supported research and educational project at the RJAH Hospital for over 50 years to benefit patients with musculo-skeletal conditions such as arthritis, rheumatism, spinal cord injuries, joint replacement and cell therapy for repair and healing.</p>
