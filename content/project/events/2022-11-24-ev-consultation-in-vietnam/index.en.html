<p>A member of the OsKoR research team, Rebecca Davies, has recently returned from Hanoi, Vietnam where she acted as a consultant for <a href="&#39;https://www.vinmec.com/en/&#39;">the Vinmec Healthcare System</a>. Here, our knowledge of mesenchymal stromal cell extracellular vesicles (MSC EVs) was used to assist the Vinmec team on enrichment and characterisation of their GMP grade MSC EVs for future use in animal studies and clinical trials.</p>
