abstract: "The whole-body X-irradiation of rats with doses of 0.5 and 1 Gy has been shown to change the rosette forming ability of cells of immune organs and to decrease the stimulating effect of mitogenes (Con A, PHA and LPS) on Ca2+ phospholipidproteinkinase activity. <br> <br> [Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15004982_The_effect_of_different_doses_of_ionizing_radiation_on_the_functional_activity_and_mechanisms_of_the_activation_of_the_lymphoid_cells_from_the_spleen_and_thymus_of_rats_exposed_to_a_stimulating_signal)"
