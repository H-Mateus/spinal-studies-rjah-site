abstract: "It was shown, that in conditions of acute radiation affection in doze 0.5 and 1 Gy, there was a decrease of 32 and 55% in activity of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases, isolated from cytosol of lymphocytes. The analysis of cAMP-dependent protein kinases properties has shown, that disturbance in the interaction of the enzyme with protein substrate of phosphotransferase reaction and main modulater enzymes activity--cAMP proceeds of the ionising radiation effect. <br> <br> [Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9876488/)"
