abstract: "Postradiation disturbances in functioning of Ca(2+)- and cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase systems are established. Kinetic index of different protein kinases of spleen lymphocytes under irradiation with doses of 0.5 and 1 Gy are analysed using return-cards-construction and Lyapunov's-coefficient-determination methods. It is shown that determined disturbances can be considered as a part of general unspecific adaptational reaction of lymphocytes to irradiation. <br> <br> [Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10366966/)"
