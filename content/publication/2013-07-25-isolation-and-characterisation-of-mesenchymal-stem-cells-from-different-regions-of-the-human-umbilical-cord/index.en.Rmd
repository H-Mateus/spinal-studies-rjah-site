abstract: "Umbilical cords as a source of stem cells are of increasing interest for cell therapies as they present little ethical consideration and are reported to contain immune privileged cells which may be suitable for allogeneic based therapies. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) sourced from several different cord regions, including artery, vein, cord lining, and Whartonâ€™s jelly, are described in the literature. However, no one study has yet isolated and characterised MSCs from all regions of the same cord to determine the most suitable cells for cell based therapeutics."
