abstract: "This paper demonstrates the use of quantitative live cell imaging techniques for assessing the quality of stem cell cultures. The aim is to investigate the use of advanced image analysis techniques to objectively assess and reliably characterize spinal cord motor neurite interactions with human bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) in an in vitro spinal cord injury model which has been developed recently. The principal goal is to better understand the mechanism responsible for neuronal growth and regeneration that are believed to be responsible for the functional improvements noted following cell transplantation for the treatment of lesions to the central nervous system."
