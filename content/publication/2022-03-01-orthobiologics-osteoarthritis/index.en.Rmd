abstract: "Osteoarthritis (OA) affects around 8.5 million people in the UK alone and the success of treating end-stage disease with joint replacement is well known. The treatment of osteoarthritis at earlier stages is less clear and represents an important area of global unmet clinical need. Around half of the 8.5 million people with OA in the UK are between 45-65 years of age, in whom knee replacement is known to have a higher risk of failure, with around 33% of primaries performed between the ages of 50 and 55 requiring revision."
