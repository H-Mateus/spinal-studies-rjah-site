abstract: "Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1) is a secreted inhibitor of Wnt signaling which in adults regulates bone turnover. Dkk-1 over-production is implicated in osteolytic disease where it inhibits bone formation and stimulates bone breakdown. Recently it was reported that osteoblastic cells from Paget's disease of bone (PDB) over-expressed Dkk-1."
