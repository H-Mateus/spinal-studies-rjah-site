abstract: "Cell cultured techniques have gained interest and popularity in osteochondral defects because, unlike bone marrow stimulation methods, where fibrocartilage fills the defect, they allow for the regeneration of 'hyaline-like cartilage' with better stiffness, resilience, and wear characteristics. Osteochondral defects in the ankle are a rare but challenging problem to treat in young active patients. If left alone, they can cause pain and reduced function and risk progressive degenerative changes in the joint. Clinical results of cell cultured and scaffold technology in the ankle, although still limited by small studies and midterm follow-up, are certainly encouraging."
