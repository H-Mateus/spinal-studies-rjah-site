abstract: "PChondrocyte isolation requires a combination of enzymatic and mechanical digestion of
cartilaginous tissues in order to release the chondrocytes. Extracted primary chondrocytes will
then adhere to standard tissue culture plastics, typically in small clusters, over a period of a
few days in monolayer culture. Chondrocyte populations are expanded in a basal medium containing
serum, supplemented with ascorbic acid, antibiotics, and sometimes antifungal agents and growth
factors. Here we describe the standard research grade and good manufacturing practice (GMP)
protocols used for the isolation and expansion of chondrocytes by the Oswestry/Keele University
Orthopaedic Research (OsKOR) group and John Charnley GMP and MHRA licensed laboratory, both based
at the RJAH Orthopaedic Hospital, Oswestry, UK."
