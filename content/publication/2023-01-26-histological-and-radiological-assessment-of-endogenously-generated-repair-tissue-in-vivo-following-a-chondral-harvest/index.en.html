abstract: "Objective - To examine repair tissue formed approximately 15 months after a chondral
harvest in the human knee.  <br><br> Design - Sixteen individuals (12 males, 4 females, mean age
36 ± 9 years) underwent a chondral harvest in the trochlea as a pre-requisite for autologous
chondrocyte implantation (ACI) treatment. The harvest site was assessed via MRI at 14.3 ± 3.2
months and arthroscopy at 15 ± 3.5 months (using the Oswestry Arthroscopy Score [O-AS] and the
International Cartilage Repair Society Arthroscopy Score [ICRS-AS]). Core biopsies (1.8 mm
diameter, n = 16) of repair tissue obtained at arthroscopy were assessed histologically (using
the ICRS II and OsScore histology scores) and examined via immunohistochemistry for the presence
of collagen types I and II.  <br><br> Results - The mean O-AS and ICRS-AS of the repaired harvest
sites were 7.2 ± 3.2 and 10.1 ± 3.5, respectively, with 80.3% ± 26% repair fill depth on MRI. The
histological quality of the repair tissue formed was variable, with some hyaline cartilage
present in 50% of the biopsies; where this occurred, it was associated with a significantly
higher ICRS-AS than those with no hyaline cartilage present (median 11 vs. 7.5, P = 0.049).
Collagen types I and II were detected in 12/14 and 10/13 biopsies, respectively.  <br><br> Conclusions - We demonstrate good-quality structural repair tissue formed following cartilage
harvest in ACI, suggesting this site can be useful to study endogenous cartilage repair in
humans. The trochlea is less commonly affected by osteoarthritis; therefore, location may be
critical for spontaneous repair. Understanding the mechanisms and factors influencing this could
improve future treatments for cartilage defects."
