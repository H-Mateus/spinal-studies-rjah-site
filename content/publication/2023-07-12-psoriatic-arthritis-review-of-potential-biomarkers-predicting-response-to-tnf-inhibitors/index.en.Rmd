abstract: "Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic and painful inflammatory immune-mediated
disease. It affects up to 40% of people with psoriasis and it is associated with several
comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and hypertension. PsA is difficult
to diagnose because of its diverse symptoms, namely axial and peripheral arthritis, enthesitis,
dactylitis, skin changes, and nail dystrophy. Different drugs exist to treat the inflammation and
pain. When patients do not respond to conventional drugs, they are treated with biologic drugs.
Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi’s) are commonly given as the first biologic drug; beside
being expensive, they also lack efficacy in 50% of patients. A biomarker predicting individual
patient’s response to TNFi would help treating them earlier with an appropriate biologic drug.
This study aimed to review the literature to identify potential biomarkers that should be
investigated for their predictive ability. Several such biomarkers were identified, namely
transmembrane TNFα (tmTNF), human serum albumin (HSA) and its half-life receptor, the neonatal Fc
receptor (FcRn) which is also involved in IgG lifespan; calprotectin, high mobility group protein
B1 (HMGB1) and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) whose overexpression lead to excessive
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines; lymphotoxin α (LTα) which induces inflammation by
binding to TNF receptor (TNFR); and T helper 17 (Th17) cells which induce inflammation by IL-17A
secretion."
