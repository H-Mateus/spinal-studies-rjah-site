abstract: "Autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are characterised by a loss of
immune tolerance, whereby the immune cells attack self-antigens causing pain and inflammation.
These conditions can be brought into remission using pharmaceutical treatments, but often have
adverse side effects and some patients do not respond favourably to them. Human umbilical cord
mesenchymal stromal cells (UCMSCs) present a promising alternative therapeutic due to their
innate anti-inflammatory properties which can be strengthened using pro-inflammatory conditions.
Their therapeutic mechanism of action has been attributed to paracrine signalling, by which
nanosized acellular particles called 'extracellular vesicles' (EVs) are one of the essential
components. Therefore, this research analysed the anti-inflammatory properties of UCMSC-EVs
'primed' with pro-inflammatory cytokines and at baseline with no inflammatory cytokines
(control). Both control and primed EVs were co-cultured with un-pooled peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs; n = 6) from healthy donors. Neither control nor primed EVs exerted a
pro-inflammatory effect on PBMCs. Instead, the primed EVs showed the immunosuppressive potential
by increasing the expression of the anti-inflammatory protein FoxP3 in PBMCs. This may be
attributed to the upregulated miRNAs identified in primed EVs in comparison to control EVs
(miR-139-5p, miR-140-5p, miR-214-5p). These findings aid in understanding how UCMSC-EVs mediate
immunosuppression and support their potential use in treating autoimmune conditions."
