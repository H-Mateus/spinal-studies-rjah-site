abstract: "Conditioned medium obtained from bone marrow-derived stem cells has been proposed as a
novel cell-free therapy in spinal cord injury and neuropathic pain, yet the direct effect on
spinal neuron function has never been investigated. Here, we adopted spinal cord organotypic
cultures (SCOCs) as an experimental model to probe the effect of ST2 murine mesenchymal stem
cells-conditioned medium (ST2-CM) on dorsal horn (DH) neuron functional properties. Three days of
SCOC exposure to ST2-CM increased neuronal activity measured by Fos expression, as well as
spontaneous or induced firing. We showed that the increase in neuronal excitability was
associated with changes in both intrinsic membrane properties and an enhanced excitatory drive.
The increased excitability at the single-cell level was substantiated at the network level by
detecting synchronous bursts of calcium waves across DH neurons. Altogether, SCOCs represent a
viable tool to probe mesenchymal cells' effect on intact neuronal networks. Our findings indicate
that ST2-CM enhances neuronal activity and synaptic wiring in the spinal dorsal horn. Our data
also support the trophic role of mesenchymal cells CM in maintaining network activity in spinal
circuits."
