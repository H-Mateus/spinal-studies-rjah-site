abstract: "Autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are characterised by a loss of
immune tolerance, whereby the immune cells attack self-antigens causing pain and infammation.
These conditions can be brought into remission using pharmaceutical treatments, but often have
adverse side efects and some patients do not respond favourably to them. Human umbilical cord
mesenchymal stromal cells (UCMSCs) present a promising alternative therapeutic due to their
innate anti-infammatory properties which can be strengthened using pro-infammatory conditions.
Their therapeutic mechanism of action has been attributed to paracrine signalling, by which
nanosized acellular particles called ‘extracellular vesicles’ (EVs) are one of the essential
components. Therefore, this research analysed the anti-infammatory properties of UCMSC-EVs
‘primed’ with pro-infammatory cytokines and at baseline with no infammatory cytokines (control).
Both control and primed EVs were co-cultured with un-pooled peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs; n=6) from healthy donors. Neither control nor primed EVs exerted a pro-infammatory efect
on PBMCs. Instead, the primed EVs showed the immunosuppressive potential by increasing the
expression of the anti-infammatory protein FoxP3 in PBMCs. This may be attributed to the
upregulated miRNAs identifed in primed EVs in comparison to control EVs (miR-139-5p, miR-140-5p,
miR-214-5p). These fndings aid in understanding how UCMSC-EVs mediate immunosuppression and
support their potential use in treating autoimmune conditions."
