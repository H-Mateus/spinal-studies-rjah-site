abstract: "Background: Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) is a complex immune-mediated disease. TNF inhibitors (TNFi) are the
first-line biologic drugs to treat PsA, targeting soluble TNF-α (sTNF) and membrane-bound TNF-α (mTNF). TNFi are
effective for about 60% of patients. We hypothesize that patients’ responses to TNFi depends on their immunophenotype,
and that the proportions of mTNF-expressing cells may influence response to TNFi. <br> <br> Objectives: To identify cell
immunophenotypes associated with greater responses to TNFi, and to verify if the proportion of mTNF+ cells forms a
potential biomarker of response in PsA.<br> <br> Methods: Blood from 18 PsA patients was sampled before and 6 months
after starting TNFi injections. The populations of T helper (Th) cells, monocytes and mTNF+ cells were determined with
flow cytometry using side and forward scatter, and CD3, CD4, CD183, CD196, CD25, CD127, HLA-DR, CD38 and mTNF
antibodies. Response at 3 and 6 months after TNFi was monitored using the PsARC scores. Patients were classified as full
responders (responders with 0 Tender Joint Score (TJS) and 0 Swollen joint Score (SJS)), weak responders (responders
with TJS and SJS) or non-responders. <br> <br> Results: Potential biomarkers measured at baseline: Three months after
TNFi, baseline proportions of Th1 cells were higher in the full responder group compared to the non-responder and
weak-responder groups (p = 0.028, Figure 1). Baseline proportions of Th17 cells were lower in the full responder group,
baseline proportions of Tregs were higher in the weak responder group. Baseline proportions of monocytes were
significantly higher in the non-responder group than in the full responder group (p = 0.027) and the weak responder
group (p = 0.022). The ratio Th1/Th17 cells was higher in the full responder group than in the non-responder and
weak-responder groups (p = 0.048). Baseline proportions of mTNF+ monocytes and lymphocytes were higher in the responder
groups than in the non-responder group. Six months after TNFi, the same trend was found for Tregs, monocytes and mTNF+
lymphocytes but not for Th1 cells, Th17 cells and mTNF+ monocytes.Percentage increase or decrease of potential
biomarkers from baseline to 6 months: The percentage increase of Th1 cells and Tregs from baseline to 6 months was
higher in the full responder group than in the other groups (Table 1). The percentage increase of Th17 cells and
activated (act) cells was higher in the non-responder group than in the weak responder group (act Th1 cells: p = 0.008,
and act Th17 cells: p = 0.003) and in the full responder group (act Th1 cells: p = 0.006, and act Th17 cells: p <
0.001). The percentage decrease of monocytes was higher in the full responder group than in the other groups. The
percentage increase of Th1/Th17 cells was higher in the full responder group than in the non-responder group (p =
0.017). The percentage of mTNF+ cells decreased in the non-responder group and increased in the weak responder
group.<br> <br> Conclusion: High proportions of Th1 and mTNF+ cells, and low proportions of Th17 cells and monocytes,
were identified as potential biomarkers of short-term response to TNFi. However, immunophenotypes seemed to change
overtime. Weak responders at 3 months can become full responders or non-responders at 6 months and more. Additional
later measurements of proportions of T helper cells, monocytes and mTNF+ cells may predict future relapse or remission
of patients with a weak short-term response and help further clinical decision-making."
