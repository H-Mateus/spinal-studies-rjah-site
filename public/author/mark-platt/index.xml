&lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis is a painful autoimmune disorder characterised by synovial inflammation that leads to progressive destruction of articular cartilage.
There is no cure for RA and life expectancy of sufferers may be reduced by up to 18 years. For that reason, it is vital to develop a new and more effective therapy for RA.
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties and function predominantly through paracrine mechanisms, via growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and bioactive, membrane-bound extracellular vesicles (EVs) found in mesenchymal stem cell conditioned medium (CM-MSC).
Our previous project demonstrated that CM-MSC reduces swelling and cartilage destruction through modulation of the immune response in a murine model of inflammatory arthritis.
This current study is assessing the contribution of extracellular vesicles to this therapeutic outcome, and examining how the culture microenvironment of MSCs can be manipulated to enhance their therapeutic effectiveness.
Extracellular vesicles are applied as a treatment in our pre-clinical model of experimental arthritis, looking at their effects on inflammation, histological outcomes of disease progression and T cell polarisation towards either pro- or anti-inflammatory cell types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stem cells isolated from human bone marrow aspirate were used to derive extracellular vesicles. Following the application of vesicles, knee joint swelling significantly reduced at both 24 and 48 hours after treatment in our pre-clinical model (Figure 1). Reductions were highly significant in comparison to control animals where knee joints continued to swell in the absence of extracellular vesicles.
Histological analysis reviled improved scores for cartilage and arthritis index (Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significant reduction in joint swelling following EVs treatment demonstrates their effectiveness as a new therapeutic intervention.
Further investigation will identify the mechanisms involved.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Up-scaling UC-MSC extracellular vesicle production for rheumatoid arthritis treatment</title>

&lt;p&gt;The anti-inflammatory properties of umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSCs) make them an attractive source for cells therapies of inflammatory based disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Yet, extracellular vesicles, which are small membrane bound particles, can recapitulate these advantageous properties through the delivery of biological cargo (protein and RNA) thereby removing concerns with safety and practicality associated with cell therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project aims to tackle some of the challenges of EV research by up-scaling UC-MSC vesicle production and exploring their subsequent characteristics and immunomodulatory potential, with particular attention given to their ability to treat RA. To do this, we will:
Determine the optimal conditions to harvest and enrich UC-MSC EVs, in which a comparison of EV collection media was performed to investigate resulting cellular attributes and EV production before conducting a trial of three EV enrichment protocols (ultracentrifugation, sucrose cushion and size exclusion chromatography).
Characterise single donor UC-MSC EVs to compare to an allogeneic strategy of EV production, to explore whether combining donors changes the resulting EV profile, with particular attention paid to their protein cargo and immunomodulatory properties.
Compare the ability of UC-MSC EVs to treat an inflammatory model of arthritis with their parental cells, by assessing their resulting histology and T-cell subsets.
Achieve the large-scale production of UC-MSC EVs using the Quantum cell expansion system, to see how this changes EV characteristics assessed previously, and how effective these EVs are at promoting an anti-inflammatory phenotype in RA derived PBMCs.&lt;/p&gt;
