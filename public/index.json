I am currently working as a postdoctoral research associate at Keele University.\nMy PhD, which was awarded in 2020, centred on the investigation of several factors that are suspected to influence cartilage repair in the knee, and was split between the lab and the clinic. The main focus of the lab-based research was the development of a novel, in vitro co-culture model to investigate the interaction between the subchondral bone and articular cartilage. The model consisted of 2D and 3D elements and was used to successfully demonstrate that the behaviour of healthy chondrocytes could be modulated by indirect co-culture with MSCs isolated from subchondral bone that demonstrated varying degrees of degeneration. In the clinic, research was focused on investigating the relationship between activity levels and knee function in patients that were undergoing rehabilitation following cell-based cartilage repair. We were able to demonstrate that the relationship between activity levels and knee function varied between patients and that some of this variation could be explained by the patients’ subjective experience of emotion, a construct termed, ’effect’. Most interestingly, we found that the patients’ effect score was the best predictor of the functional outcome of cell-based cartilage repair, even when adjusted for previously reported predictors such as age, gender and BMI.\nSince then, I have been working on several projects focusing on the contribution of the synovium to the health and disease of the knee joint. In one project I have been investigating the polarisation of synovial macrophages in early- and late-stage osteoarthritis to characterise their role in disease progression. I have also been collaborating with a number of centres to decellularise human synovium extracellular matrix for repopulation with pathogenic human macrophages to investigate cell-matrix interactions.\nI will soon be moving to Queen Mary University of London, where I will be working with Dr Clare Thompson to develop disease-relevant, in vitro models of the human synovium, built upon her synovium-on-a-chip model. We plan to develop early- and late-stage OA synovium-on-a-chip models by introducing relevant primary synovial fibroblasts and macrophages. Subsequently, we will use these models to assess the response of the synovium, at these disease stages, to biologically relevant disease and treatment stimuli.\nNow working at Queen Mary University of London - Profile\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e15f52c3a478648d655baf0120549bf3","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/author/timothy-hopkins/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/timothy-hopkins/","section":"authors","summary":"body {\rtext-align: justify}\r\rI am a cell and tissue engineer with an interest in the development of biomimetic, in-vitro models of musculoskeletal tissues.

What may be particularly useful is that 3 of these parameters at 1 year after treatment (how much tissue, its composition and the smoothness of the surface) all affected the clinical outcome in the long term (up to 17 years after treatment).

A note on working with org-mode files An alternative: RMarkdown   Formatting Headings and lists Links and images Symbols and equations Code and foldable blocks Diagrams Todo lists Tables Callouts Spoilers Icons  \r\rThis is a brief introduction to formatting in org-mode made mostly to help my dear colleagues with writing content for the site\nWhy org-mode? This website uses a single org-mode file to manage most of the content. Org-mode is an example of a markup language, which means the text formating is described in the text itself. This is in contrast to a “what you see is what you get” system where the formatting information is hidden from the user and stored in the file data somehow, as Microsoft Word does with it’s proprietary file formats.\nThere are several advantages to using plain text. Perhaps the most important of which is transportability and reproducibility. You can’t view or edit a .doc file without special software (which you often have to pay for), whereas plain text files can be viewed an edited on any computer, regardless of operating system, and with thousands of text editors to choose from.\nThe only real disadvantage to markup languages is that you have to learn their syntax. This is only really an issue for some languages though, html (the language website are written in) is fairly complicated and fiddly, but languages like markdown and org-mode were made to be simple and easy to learn. And this post is going to demonstrate the basics, so read on!\nPlus, with a bit of magic from pandoc you can convert pretty much any markup language to any other markup language. This lets us do things like export a markdown file to a really nice pdf, or html document!\nA note on working with org-mode files Org-mode is made to be used with the wonderful Emacs, which sells itself as an extensible text editor, but it’s really just an elisp interpreter geared towards text editing. Emacs makes working with org-mode files a joy, though it has a bit of a learning curve itself. There are plenty of great guides and videos for getting to grips with emacs, but you can of course use whatever plain text editor you like!\nAn alternative: RMarkdown I’m using org-mode because I like emacs, but you can also use the wonderful RMarkdown to create posts, and if you’re a fan of RStudio, there’s a neat package called blogdown to make adding content super easy. I suspect some of you may prefer that, it is probably easier to get up an running with compared to emacs…\nFormatting For example, if you would like bold text, you simply wrap the text with * like so: *bold* similarly, we can have:\nTable 1:\rIf you\u0026#39;re wondering how I\u0026#39;m able to show the formatting without it rendering have a look at this .org file on the git repository\r\r   Rendered text Raw text     italics /italics/   monospace =monospace=   code ~code~   strike-through +strike-through+   underlined _underlined_    If you want a footnote 1 use [fn:: footnote text goes here]. It even comes with a helpful return link!\nHeadings and lists For headings org-mode uses *:\n * Level one header ** Level two header *** Level three header  and so on. Org-mode will automatically scale the text to the size of the level of the header.\nFor bullet point lists use - or + or numbers 1. The following:\n using -  - item 1 - item 2\n using +  + item 1 + item 2\n using numbers  1. numbered list 1 2. numbered list 2\nRenders to:\n  using -\n item 1 item 2    using +\n item 1 item 2    using numbers\n numbered list 1 numbered list 2    Links and images To insert links use square brackets like so: [[link_address_goes_here][text_goes_here]] The link in the previous sentence looks like this: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink][links]]\nTo insert images we do the same, but the link has to point to an image in the static/images directory of the site. So [[/images/red_panda.jpeg]] Results in the following image being embedded:\n\r\rFigure 1: I know the feeling panda… Image credit: Unsplash\r And if you’re wondering about the captions, just add header on the line above whatever you want caption:\n#+CAPTION: caption text goes here thing you want a caption on goes here(normally an image or table)\nSymbols and equations For things like Greek letters just type the letter after a \\ like so:\n   α \\alpha     β \\beta   γ \\gamma   ± \\pm   ≥ \\ge   ≠ \\neq    For more complex equations we can use latex math syntax and wrap in single $ for inline equations, and double $$ for equation blocks. So $a=+\\sqrt{2}$ renders to \\(a=+\\sqrt{2}\\).\nAnd $$P\\left(A=2\\middle|\\frac{A^2}{B}\u0026gt;4\\right)$$ renders to\n\\[P\\left(A=2\\middle|\\frac{A^2}{B}\u0026gt;4\\right)\\]\nWe can also wrap in \\( and close with \\) for inline and \\[ \\] for blocks to produce the same effect\nCode and foldable blocks So there’s this awesome package called org-babel that let you include code from pretty much any widely used language in org-mode files. I won’t go into depth on org-babel here as there’s a lot to it, but I’ll use it to demonstrate folding …","date":1606953600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606953600,"objectID":"89d49e610cbf48bac43984876762dfdf","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/post/org_mode_basics_2020-12-03/","publishdate":"2020-12-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/org_mode_basics_2020-12-03/","section":"post","summary":"Brief introduction to org-mode formatting","tags":["orgmode","tutorials","emacs"],"title":"Org-mode basics","type":"post"},{"authors":["Gabriel Mateus Bernardo Harrington","Paul Cool","Charlotte Hulme","Aheed Osman","Joy Chowdhury","Naveen Kumar","Srinivasa Budithi","Karina Wright"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1595519608,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595519608,"objectID":"ecc06b6b2ffa9b97f099ee16b7eb7776","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/sci_routine_modelling_2020-12-02/","publishdate":"2020-07-27T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sci_routine_modelling_2020-12-02/","section":"publication","summary":"A follow up to our [perliminary paper](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/neu.2019.6495) with a larger cohort","tags":["Prognostic modelling","Spinal cord injury"],"title":"Routinely measured haematological markers can help to predict AIS scores following spinal cord injury","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karina Wright","Charlotte Hulme","Paul Cool","Mateus Harrington","Jessica Fisher-Stokes"],"categories":null,"content":"The focus of this project is to develop a prognostic biomarker panel for spinal cord injury (SCI) and to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms involved in nerve injury in order to identify new targets with potential for nerve repair.\nThe student will use proteomic (iTRAQ), biochemical and bioinformatic analyses to investigate the serum proteome. iTRAQ proteomics analyses will be used to identify potential prognostic indicators/new targets in models of SCI.

Here, we report two first-in-man cases (patient A and B) treated with combined autologous chondrocyte and bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell implantation (CACAMI), with 8-year follow up. Two patients with International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grade III–IV cartilage lesions underwent a co-implantation of autologous chondrocytes and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) between February 2008 and October 2009. In brief, chondrocytes and BM-MSCs were separately isolated and culture-expanded in a good manufacturing practice laboratory for a period of 2–4 weeks. Cells were then implanted in combination into cartilage defects and patients were clinically evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively, using the self-reported Lysholm knee score and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Postoperative Lysholm scores were compared with the Oswestry risk of knee arthroplasty (ORKA) scores. Patient A also had a second-look arthroscopy, at which time a biopsy of the repair site was taken. Both patients demonstrated a significant longterm improvement in knee function, with postoperative Lysholm scores being consistently higher than ORKA predictions. The most recent Lysholm scores, 8 years after surgery were 100/100 (Patient A) and 88/100 (Patient B), where 100 represents a fully functioning knee joint. Bone marrow lesion (BML) volume was shown to decrease on postoperative MRIs in both patients. Cartilage defect area increased in patient A, but declined initially for patient B, slightly increasing again 2 years after treatment. The repair site biopsy taken from patient A at 14 months postoperatively, demonstrated a thin layer of fibrocartilage covering the treated defect site. The use of a combination of cultured autologous chondrocytes and BM-MSCs appears to confer long-term benefit in this two-patient case study. Improvements in knee function perhaps relate to the observed reduction in the size of the BML.","tags":["Cartilage repair","Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation"],"title":"Combined Autologous Chondrocyte and Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Implantation in the Knee: An 8-year Follow Up of Two First-In-Man Cases","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rebecca Davies","Nicola Kuiper"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1552089600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552089600,"objectID":"99555441f082a1d8e83c9198e2e7751d","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/review_evolution_aci_2021-01-27/","publishdate":"2019-03-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/review_evolution_aci_2021-01-27/","section":"publication","summary":"Articular cartilage is composed of chondrons within a territorial matrix surrounded by a highly organized extracellular matrix comprising collagen II fibrils, proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans, and non-collagenous proteins. Damaged articular cartilage has a limited potential for healing and untreated defects often progress to osteoarthritis. High hopes have been pinned on regenerative medicine strategies to meet the challenge of preventing progress to late osteoarthritis. One such strategy, autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), was first reported in 1994 as a treatment for deep focal articular cartilage defects. ACI has since evolved to become a worldwide well-established surgical technique. For ACI, chondrocytes are harvested from the lesser weight bearing edge of the joint by arthroscopy, their numbers expanded in monolayer culture for at least four weeks, and then re-implanted in the damaged region under a natural or synthetic membrane via an open joint procedure. We consider the evolution of ACI to become an established cell therapy, its current limitations, and on-going strategies to improve its efficacy. The most promising developments involving cells and natural or synthetic biomaterials will be highlighted.","tags":["Articular Cartilage","Regenerative Medicine","Chondron","Extracellular Matrix","Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation","Cell Therapy"],"title":"Regenerative Medicine: A Review of the Evolution of Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (ACI) Therapy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jingsong Wang","Sally Roberts","Jan Herman Kuiper","Weiguo Zhang","John Garcia","Zhanfeng Cui","Karina Wright"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1602518008,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602518008,"objectID":"fe41d83f9378374bdee2287a47ea77b4","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/characterisation_meniscal_cell_region_2021-02-01/","publishdate":"2020-10-12T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/characterisation_meniscal_cell_region_2021-02-01/","section":"publication","summary":"Meniscus degeneration is closely related to the progression of knee osteoarthritis (OA).

Flow cytometry results showed that a significantly greater percentage of meniscal cells were positive for CD49b, CD49c and CD166 compared to donor-matched chondrocytes after 14 days in monolayer culture. The integrins, CD49b and CD29, were expressed at a significantly higher level on avascular meniscal cells derived from tissues with a more degenerated inner border than non-degenerate menisci, suggesting that the integrin family may play an important role in meniscus OA pathology. Collagen fibres arranged in a “tree-like” formation within the meniscus appeared to have less blood vessels associated with them in the vascular region of the most degenerate menisci, which may indicate that such structures are involved in the pathological process. We have demonstrated that meniscal cells derived from the lateral meniscus in medial OA patients have chondrogenic capacity in vitro and hence could represent a potential cell source to consider for meniscus tissue engineering.","tags":[],"title":"Characterization of regional meniscal cell and chondrocyte phenotypes and chondrogenic differentiation with histological analysis in osteoarthritic donor-matched tissues","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Events"],"content":"\r\rSponsored walk - 2023\n\rSnowpaedic challende - 2022\n\rLondon Marathon - 2021\r\rSponsord walk at the Llyn Brenig Lake\r\rOn the 16th of September 2023, researchers and students of the OSKOR groups participated in a walk around the beautiful Llyn Brenig Lake, and raised money to improve research in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.\rDuchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder marked by the gradual weakening and degeneration of muscles.

Objectives: To identify cell immunophenotypes associated with greater responses to TNFi, and to verify if the proportion of mTNF+ cells forms a potential biomarker of response in PsA.\nMethods: Blood from 18 PsA patients was sampled before and 6 months after starting TNFi injections. The populations of T helper (Th) cells, monocytes and mTNF+ cells were determined with flow cytometry using side and forward scatter, and CD3, CD4, CD183, CD196, CD25, CD127, HLA-DR, CD38 and mTNF antibodies. Response at 3 and 6 months after TNFi was monitored using the PsARC scores. Patients were classified as full responders (responders with 0 Tender Joint Score (TJS) and 0 Swollen joint Score (SJS)), weak responders (responders with TJS and SJS) or non-responders. Results: Potential biomarkers measured at baseline: Three months after TNFi, baseline proportions of Th1 cells were higher in the full responder group compared to the non-responder and weak-responder groups (p = 0.028, Figure 1). Baseline proportions of Th17 cells were lower in the full responder group, baseline proportions of Tregs were higher in the weak responder group. Baseline proportions of monocytes were significantly higher in the non-responder group than in the full responder group (p = 0.027) and the weak responder group (p = 0.022). The ratio Th1/Th17 cells was higher in the full responder group than in the non-responder and weak-responder groups (p = 0.048). Baseline proportions of mTNF+ monocytes and lymphocytes were higher in the responder groups than in the non-responder group. Six months after TNFi, the same trend was found for Tregs, monocytes and mTNF+ lymphocytes but not for Th1 cells, Th17 cells and mTNF+ monocytes.Percentage increase or decrease of potential biomarkers from baseline to 6 months: The percentage increase of Th1 cells and Tregs from baseline to 6 months was higher in the full responder group than in the other groups (Table 1). The percentage increase of Th17 cells and activated (act) cells was higher in the non-responder group than in the weak responder group (act Th1 cells: p = 0.008, and act Th17 cells: p = 0.003) and in the full responder group (act Th1 cells: p = 0.006, and act Th17 cells: p ","tags":["Psoriatic Arthritis","Biomarkers"],"title":"PARIS Study: Potential biomarkers predicting response to TNFi in Psoriatic Arthritis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oksana Kehoe","Rebecca Davies","Anais Makos","Henry Barrett"],"categories":["Events"],"content":"\r\rUKEV forum 2024\rInternational Society of Extracellular Vesicles 2022, 2023\rEV consultation in Vietnam\r\r\rUKEV forum 2024\r\rOur group had the pleasure of participating in the UKEV Forum 2024, a premier event focused on extracellular vesicle\r(EV) research and innovation.

This study has utilised proteomic and bioinformatics methodologies to investigate differentially expressed proteins in plasma samples across human SCI cohorts with the aim of identifying candidate prognostic biomarkers and biological pathway alterations that relate to neurological outcome. The data demonstrated proteomic differences between the SCI improver and non-improver cohorts, with the results from two independent approaches supporting each other and identifying 79 and 87 differences in total between the groups. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that the majority of differentially abundant proteins were components of the complement cascade and most interacted directly with the liver. Additional investigations into the chronology of these proteins, and their levels in other tissues (cerebrospinal fluid in particular) are needed to better understand the underlying pathophysiology, including any potentially modifiable targets.

Samples of prosthetic f luid were taken during revision surgery from patients with known PJIs. Samples from revision surgeries from non-infected patients acted as negative controls. Genomic sequencing was performed using the MinION device and the rapid sequencing kit from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Bioinformatic analysis pipelines to identify bacteria included Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, Kraken2 and MinION Detection Software, and the results were compared with standard of care microbiological cultures. Furthermore, there was an attempt to predict antibiotic resistance using computational tools including ResFinder, AMRFinderPlus and Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database. Bacteria identified using microbiological cultures were successfully identified using bioinformatic analysis pipelines. Nanopore sequencing and genomic classification could be completed in the time it takes to perform joint revision surgery (2–3 h). Genomic sequencing in this study was not able to predict antibiotic resistance in this time frame, this is thought to be due to a short-read length and low read depth. It can be concluded that genomic sequencing can be useful to identify bacterial species in infected joint replacements. However, further work is required to investigate if it can be used to predict antibiotic resistance within clinically relevant timeframes.","tags":[],"title":"Using Nanopore sequencing to identify bacterial infection in joint replacements, preliminary study.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martyn Snow","Nishant Singh","Larissa Rix","Mohammad Haikal"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","date":1707436800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1712142096,"objectID":"d3cd6b7edc72c781e1a4daadc7af55c6","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/no-correlation-exists-between-tibial-and-femoral-based-measurements-of-patella-alta-in-a-population-with-chronic-patellofemoral-pain-or-instability-undergoing-patella-distalization/","publishdate":"2024-02-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/no-correlation-exists-between-tibial-and-femoral-based-measurements-of-patella-alta-in-a-population-with-chronic-patellofemoral-pain-or-instability-undergoing-patella-distalization/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose - To investigate whether the patellotrochlear index (PTI) predicts patella alta as determined by tibial-based methods of Insall–Salvati (IS) and Caton–Deschamp (CDI) indexes in a pathological population (with patellofemoral pain and/or instability), in addition to determining whether PTI and sagittal patellofemoral engagement (SPE) correlate with trochlea length as determined by lateral condyle index (LCI). Methods - Patients with confirmed patella alta (IS/CDI ratio 1.2) undergoing tibial tubercle osteotomy for patellofemoral pain/instability with an available magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were included. Patients who had undergone previous soft-tissue realignment, previous surgery, or trauma to the extensor mechanism were excluded.

Arthritis is a wide-spread disease which affects our joints, and osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form. In the UK, approximately 1/5 of over-45s have been diagnosed with OA, the knee being the most frequently affected joint. The cause of OA is unknown but it develops when cartilage wears out. Knee injury in young adults can increase their risk of developing knee OA sixfold. OA is treated with physiotherapy, painkillers, surgery, or as a last resort, a joint replacement.\nCartilage repair surgeries focus on stopping knee pain and improving function but may also slow OA. It’s important to measure outcomes following surgery to understand if they have worked. There are different ways to assess outcome for knee cartilage surgery including clinical (e.g., need for re-operation or joint replacement), X-rays, cartilage or bone tests, studying genes or proteins in blood samples, or ‘patient reported’ (e.g., questionnaires). Outcomes are collected and stored in large health databases and registries.\nIdeally, knee cartilage surgeries in middle-aged patients will slow down OA and delay or eliminate the need for joint replacement. We don’t know if this happens in reality. I plan to work out the true effect of knee cartilage surgeries by studying health records and outcome measures.\nThe Robert Jones \u0026amp; Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic NHS Hospital in Oswestry specialises in bone and joint disorders. Uniquely, it has cartilage surgery data spanning more than 20 years. I plan to link this information with the National Joint Registry (results from joint replacements) to work out the time from surgery to joint replacement to see if I can predict when and for whom cartilage surgery would be successful. Also, I plan to use the UK Biobank (health records and risk factors for the major diseases of middle and old age) to find out whether cartilage surgery can help patients with a higher genetic risk of OA onset.\nThe study will help patients with cartilage defects by giving orthopaedic surgeons a tool to help fit cartilage treatment to their patients to delay or avoid the development of severe OA. This will improve their quality of life and reduce the need for knee replacements, both of which represent health-economic benefits. This potential cost benefit also fits with the NHS national programme “GIRFT” (https://gettingitrightfirsttime.co.uk/).\n","date":1705276800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1705323731,"objectID":"9406b18ef4e9605edf6f4fbcf60197b5","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/project/does-knee-cartilage-repair-surgery-prevent-arthritis-or-the-need-for-a-joint-replacement/","publishdate":"2024-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/does-knee-cartilage-repair-surgery-prevent-arthritis-or-the-need-for-a-joint-replacement/","section":"project","summary":"Funded by the Daphne Jackson Trust, the Orthopaedic Research UK and the Medical Research Council","tags":["Cartilage repair","Arthritis","Osteoarthritis","Current projects"],"title":"Does knee cartilage repair surgery prevent arthritis or the need for a joint replacement?","type":"project"},{"authors":["Esri H Juárez","Chelsea R Wood","Rebecca Davies","Oksana Kehoe","William E B Johnson","Adalberto Merighi","Francesco Ferrini"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n","date":1693958400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698846597,"objectID":"d102e817d0683c711f8b446ba18206fb","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/st2-conditioned-medium-fosters-dorsal-horn-cell-excitability-and-synaptic-transmission-in-cultured-mouse-spinal-cord/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/st2-conditioned-medium-fosters-dorsal-horn-cell-excitability-and-synaptic-transmission-in-cultured-mouse-spinal-cord/","section":"publication","summary":"Conditioned medium obtained from bone marrow-derived stem cells has been proposed as a novel cell-free therapy in spinal cord injury and neuropathic pain, yet the direct effect on spinal neuron function has never been investigated.

Three days of SCOC exposure to ST2-CM increased neuronal activity measured by Fos expression, as well as spontaneous or induced firing. We showed that the increase in neuronal excitability was associated with changes in both intrinsic membrane properties and an enhanced excitatory drive. The increased excitability at the single-cell level was substantiated at the network level by detecting synchronous bursts of calcium waves across DH neurons. Altogether, SCOCs represent a viable tool to probe mesenchymal cells' effect on intact neuronal networks. Our findings indicate that ST2-CM enhances neuronal activity and synaptic wiring in the spinal dorsal horn.

These conditions can be brought into remission using pharmaceutical treatments, but often have adverse side effects and some patients do not respond favourably to them. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells (UCMSCs) present a promising alternative therapeutic due to their innate anti-inflammatory properties which can be strengthened using pro-inflammatory conditions. Their therapeutic mechanism of action has been attributed to paracrine signalling, by which nanosized acellular particles called 'extracellular vesicles' (EVs) are one of the essential components. Therefore, this research analysed the anti-inflammatory properties of UCMSC-EVs 'primed' with pro-inflammatory cytokines and at baseline with no inflammatory cytokines (control). Both control and primed EVs were co-cultured with un-pooled peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs; n = 6) from healthy donors. Neither control nor primed EVs exerted a pro-inflammatory effect on PBMCs. Instead, the primed EVs showed the immunosuppressive potential by increasing the expression of the anti-inflammatory protein FoxP3 in PBMCs. This may be attributed to the upregulated miRNAs identified in primed EVs in comparison to control EVs (miR-139-5p, miR-140-5p, miR-214-5p). These findings aid in understanding how UCMSC-EVs mediate immunosuppression and support their potential use in treating autoimmune conditions.","tags":["Umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells","Extracellular Vesicles"],"title":"Extracellular vesicles derived from umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells show enhanced anti-inflammatory properties via upregulation of miRNAs after pro-inflammatory priming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Helen McCarthy","Bernhard Tins","Peter Gallacher","Paul Jermin","James Richardson","Jan Herman Kuiper","Sally Roberts"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n","date":1674691200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698849468,"objectID":"ad9160de5b526d7fa9831defc123fa52","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/histological-and-radiological-assessment-of-endogenously-generated-repair-tissue-in-vivo-following-a-chondral-harvest/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/histological-and-radiological-assessment-of-endogenously-generated-repair-tissue-in-vivo-following-a-chondral-harvest/","section":"publication","summary":"Objective - To examine repair tissue formed approximately 15 months after a chondral harvest in the human knee. Design - Sixteen individuals (12 males, 4 females, mean age 36 ± 9 years) underwent a chondral harvest in the trochlea as a pre-requisite for autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) treatment. The harvest site was assessed via MRI at 14.3 ± 3.2 months and arthroscopy at 15 ± 3.5 months (using the Oswestry Arthroscopy Score [O-AS] and the International Cartilage Repair Society Arthroscopy Score [ICRS-AS]). Core biopsies (1.8 mm diameter, n = 16) of repair tissue obtained at arthroscopy were assessed histologically (using the ICRS II and OsScore histology scores) and examined via immunohistochemistry for the presence of collagen types I and II. Results - The mean O-AS and ICRS-AS of the repaired harvest sites were 7.2 ± 3.2 and 10.1 ± 3.5, respectively, with 80.3% ± 26% repair fill depth on MRI. The histological quality of the repair tissue formed was variable, with some hyaline cartilage present in 50% of the biopsies; where this occurred, it was associated with a significantly higher ICRS-AS than those with no hyaline cartilage present (median 11 vs. 7.5, P = 0.049). Collagen types I and II were detected in 12/14 and 10/13 biopsies, respectively. Conclusions - We demonstrate good-quality structural repair tissue formed following cartilage harvest in ACI, suggesting this site can be useful to study endogenous cartilage repair in humans. The trochlea is less commonly affected by osteoarthritis; therefore, location may be critical for spontaneous repair. Understanding the mechanisms and factors influencing this could improve future treatments for cartilage defects.","tags":["Cartilage","Cartilage Regeneration","Osteoarthritis"],"title":"Histological and Radiological Assessment of Endogenously Generated Repair Tissue In Vivo Following a Chondral Harvest","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anaïs Makos","Jan Herman Kuiper","Oksana Kehoe","Roshan Amarasena"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n","date":1670803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689171872,"objectID":"e97776ec344aa1a05c81799727dda6eb","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/psoriatic-arthritis-review-of-potential-biomarkers-predicting-response-to-tnf-inhibitors/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/psoriatic-arthritis-review-of-potential-biomarkers-predicting-response-to-tnf-inhibitors/","section":"publication","summary":"Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic and painful inflammatory immune-mediated disease. It affects up to 40% of people with psoriasis and it is associated with several comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and hypertension. PsA is difficult to diagnose because of its diverse symptoms, namely axial and peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, dactylitis, skin changes, and nail dystrophy. Different drugs exist to treat the inflammation and pain. When patients do not respond to conventional drugs, they are treated with biologic drugs. Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi’s) are commonly given as the first biologic drug; beside being expensive, they also lack efficacy in 50% of patients. A biomarker predicting individual patient’s response to TNFi would help treating them earlier with an appropriate biologic drug. This study aimed to review the literature to identify potential biomarkers that should be investigated for their predictive ability. Several such biomarkers were identified, namely transmembrane TNFα (tmTNF), human serum albumin (HSA) and its half-life receptor, the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) which is also involved in IgG lifespan; calprotectin, high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) whose overexpression lead to excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines; lymphotoxin α (LTα) which induces inflammation by binding to TNF receptor (TNFR); and T helper 17 (Th17) cells which induce inflammation by IL-17A secretion.","tags":["Biomarkers","Psoriatic Arthritis"],"title":"Psoriatic arthritis: review of potential biomarkers predicting response to TNF inhibitors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paul Harrison","Timothy Hopkins","Charlotte Hulme","Helen McCarthy","Karina Wright"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n","date":1668124800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698849133,"objectID":"1ba8e2ca0bcacf23d4472a87c119a774","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/chondrocyte-isolation-and-expansion/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chondrocyte-isolation-and-expansion/","section":"publication","summary":"PChondrocyte isolation requires a combination of enzymatic and mechanical digestion of cartilaginous tissues in order to release the chondrocytes.

One of the surgical procedures used to treat these defects is to implant donor cartilage and bone from fresh osteochondral allografts (OCA). For this surgical intervention to be successful it is important that OCA are implanted within 28 days of harvest from the human tissue donor. This is to ensure that the viability of cartilage cells (called chondrocytes) remains above 70%; the level demonstrated to correlate with good clinical outcomes in animal studies.\nOCA was pioneered in the USA and due to it’s early success, the technique is now being used by orthopaedic surgeons across the globe and has recently been commissioned for use on the NHS. There is limited availability of grafts and consequently, there is great demand to transport OCA grafts via air carriers over long distances. Recent published data along with data from our preliminary investigations has shown that the viability of clinical OCA is well below industry standards. This in turn may have negative impacts on the clinical effectiveness of grafts which are transported internationally. There is a significant need to determine how individual and combined influences of supply chain transport conditions influence cell viability, tissue matrix integrity and the biomechanical properties of grafts in order to develop optimised processes for OCA supply.\nThis exciting project will involve a comprehensive study to investigate the effect of prolonged transport on allograft chondrocyte viability and the potential benefits of transport using alternative reagents and conditions. The project aims to optimise the storage and delivery of OCA and to explore the cryopreservation of grafts in order to prolong cell viability and increase graft availability for surgical use and as a source of cells for innovative cell-based therapies.\nThe successful applicant will work closely within a diverse multi-disciplinary team across a number of specialities and collaboratively with US industry partners. The highly desirable skills that will be developed through this PhD will span laboratory skills (including tissue culture, cryobiology and cellular analytic techniques e.g. flow cytometry, RNA and protein analysis, as well as tissue histological/immunohistochemical analysis, advanced tissue imaging techniques, biochemical analysis and biomechanical testing), as well as, developing a strong knowledge base in global tissue transport, human consenting/tissue handling procedures, supply chain logistics and manufacturing of cell-based therapies.\nAs part of this project, you will have the opportunity to provide a solution to an urgent clinical problem, which will have a potentially major, and quickly realised, impact on the quality of life of patients. The studentship will be based in the OSKOR group at the RJAH Orthopaedic Hospital in Oswestry. The OSKOR is an internationally recognised group with expertise in the manufacture and development of novel cell-based therapies aimed at treating osteochondral defects/OA. The studentship will also undertake work with specialists at other collaborating Universities including Birmingham, Exeter and Loughborough to explore the biomechanical and structural consequences of extended storage and to engage with specific cryobiology expertise.\nThis PhD is suitable for home students with a degree in the biological/natural sciences - minimum degree classification 2i.

Autoimmunity occurs when the immune system attacks the body. Regulatory cells (also called Tregs) are cells of immune system which have a role in regulating or suppressing other cells in the immune system. Tregs control the immune response to self and foreign particles and help prevent autoimmune disease. Understanding how Tregs supress cells in the immune system could help improve treatments for people with autoimmune conditions including lupus, type 1 diabetes, Sjögren syndrome, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. In rheumatoid arthritis, the immune system destroys the lining of the joints. At present, autoimmune conditions cannot be cured. Tregs communicate with other cells in the immune system by producing the little particles called extracellular vesicles. This project will explore these particles to find out what’s inside them and how they differ in healthy people and patients with rheumatoid arthritis using a variety of different tests. Next, this project will explore how the extracellular vesicles function. We will add the particles into a dish with immune cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. These cells are overactive, which causes the pain, inflammation and swelling in the joints, so we want to see if our extracellular vesicles can suppress these immune cells. If these experiments are successful and the extracellular vesicles contain anti-inflammatory properties, then they have the potential to be applied to many different autoimmune conditions.\nThe overarching aim of this proposal is to define the feasibility of using Tregs-derived EVs as a biological therapeutic for RA patients. The project will meet this aim through the achievement of four primary objectives:\n\rIsolate and investigate phenotypic and functional properties of ex vivo expanded Tregs from the peripheral blood of RA patients and healthy volunteers.\n\rIsolate Tregs-derived EVs and define their vesicular properties according to internationally agreed criterion (ISEV 2019).\n\rQuantify and compare the suppressive efficacy of EVs derived from disease or healthy donors.\n\rIdentify the differentially-expressed vesicular factors that are potentially responsible for their suppressive effects.\n\r\r","date":1658361600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658409783,"objectID":"9e3baab96685d5ece9bc2e7759b27a2e","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/project/the-potential-utility-of-human-regulatory-t-cell-derived-ev-to-control-inflammation-in-ra/","publishdate":"2022-07-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/the-potential-utility-of-human-regulatory-t-cell-derived-ev-to-control-inflammation-in-ra/","section":"project","summary":"Funded by the Orthopaedic Institute and Kee...","tags":["Biology","Current projects"],"title":"The potential utility of human regulatory T cell-derived EV to control inflammation in RA","type":"project"},{"authors":["Karina Wright","Helen McCarthy","Charlotte Hulme","Jan Kuiper","Martyn Snow","Abi Jones"],"categories":[],"content":"\rPhD project: TRANSCRIPTOMIC, PROTEOMIC AND BIOINFORMATICS ANALYSES OF CELL-BASED THERAPIES FOR CARTILAGE INJURIES IN HUMANS\nSupervisors: Dr Karina Wright, Prof Mandy Peffers, Dr Dan Tonge, Dr Helen McCarthy , Dr Charlotte Hulme, Dr Jan Herman Kuiper and Professor Martyn Snow.\nBackground: The RJAH orthopaedic hospital and Keele University have used a cell-based therapy (autologous chondrocyte implantation or ACI) to treat damaged cartilage in knees and other joints for over 20 years. Since 2016 Drs Wright, Kuiper, McCarthy and Hulme have been involved in a clinical trial to determine if cells from the bone marrow (mesenchymal stromal cells, BM-MSCs) may produce superior results compared to chondrocytes, either alone or in combination (ASCOT: Autologous Stem cells, Chondrocytes or the Two) (Eudract number 2010-022072-31). Clinical benefit in terms of functional recovery is the primary outcome, but the team also have approval to undertake considerable exploratory research alongside the trial itself, for example to determine if the implanted cells have particular ‘markers’ on their surface or within their transcriptome/proteome which could help predict their efficacy or ‘potency.’\nPreliminary work: A powered half-way mRNA and miRNA-sequencing analysis of the implanted cellular therapies (66 patients) has recently been completed (funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC)) and has formed the basis of a bioinformatics-focused PhD studentship, in part funded by the Versus Arthritis Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Therapies (VA-TERT) Centre and Keele University. This studentship is expected to complete within the next 12 months and has already highlighted a series of individual markers (e.g. cartilage matrix molecules, catabolic enzymes and cytokines) and biological pathways (e.g. TGF-b signalling, cell adhesion and toll-like receptor signalling) that relate to outcome for each cell-based therapy.\nThe objectives of the current studentship are to (1) complete the mRNA and miRNA (transcriptome) sequencing for all 114 patients, (2) undertake paired label-free proteomic analysis, (3) carry out a systems bioinformatics analysis (to interrelate transcriptome and proteome data) and (4) to determine identifiable markers that relate to outcomes. The studentship will leverage the transcriptomic and bioinformatics methodologies developed in Dr Wright and Tonge’s interim analysis and those established for proteomics in Prof Peffers and Dr Wright’s groups.\nMethods and Training: The planned RNA-sequencing is being carried out by a sequencing service provider (funded by the MRC) and is anticipated to be complete within the first four months of the studentship. Meanwhile the PhD candidate will undertake training in the preparation of samples for label free proteomics analysis with Drs Wright, Hulme and Prof Peffers and the validation of transcriptome data with Drs Tonge and McCarthy. Statistical guidance will be provided by Dr Kuiper and clinical input from Prof Snow. A patient representative (Ms Gracey-McMinn) will also have an integral role, steering the studentship from a patient perspective.\nOn receiving the transcriptomic and proteomic data, the candidate will aim to (1) identify a set of genes/proteins that are significantly differentially expressed between the treatment groups or that correlate to specific outcome measures and (2) condense these into meaningful biological pathways/networks. These two steps will be used to determine, at the molecular level, the mechanisms responsible for mediating the effects of each transplanted cell population. Together, these analyses will aim to identify molecular profiles which can help to predict clinical efficacy.\nA wealth of clinical data is collected throughout the ASCOT trial. Lysholm score (a patient-reported functional score) and a series of imaging scores will be available at 12-months post-operatively for comparative expression analyses. Further, histological assessments of repair site biopsies also taken at 12-months will also be available.\nImplanted cells have already been characterised by determining their surface marker immunoprofile as part of the ASCOT trial. The candidate will interrogate transcriptome, proteome and immunoprofile data to identify whether gene/protein signatures of interest relate to a more easily measurable cell surface marker signature, of use for future cell release and potency assessment criteria. In addition, the student will bioinformatically compare cell types across donors and within donor-matched groups. Further demographic comparisons of transcriptome and proteome data will focus on features such as gender, age and BMI which are known to influence the outcome of orthopaedic cell-based therapies.\n","date":1658361600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658409468,"objectID":"4a71d048ef76fcc4a9bf7e523d686c6f","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/project/transcriptomic-proteomic-and-bioinformatics-analyses-of-cell-based-therapies/","publishdate":"2022-07-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/transcriptomic-proteomic-and-bioinformatics-analyses-of-cell-based-therapies/","section":"project","summary":"Funded by Versus arthritis","tags":["Biology","Current projects"],"title":"Transcriptomic, proteomic and bioinformatics analyses of cell-based therapies","type":"project"},{"authors":["Rebecca Davies","Mairead Hyland","Claire Mennan","Karina Wright","Mark Platt","Oksana Kehoe"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n","date":1657152000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657183056,"objectID":"0744531e967b696d497e64b43ddc7c55","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/the-therapeutic-effect-of-umbilical-cord-mesenchymal-stromal-cell-extracellular-vesicles-in-inflammatory-arthritis/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/the-therapeutic-effect-of-umbilical-cord-mesenchymal-stromal-cell-extracellular-vesicles-in-inflammatory-arthritis/","section":"publication","summary":"Introduction - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease of which there is no cure. Cell therapies using umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSCs) are becoming a popular possibility for treatment due to their ability to promote immunosuppression. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) mimic this but offer the advantage of safety (no malignant transformation or rejection), being easily stored and an extended shelf life. Hence, we sought to determine the ability of UC-MSCs, and their derived EVs, to treat RA using an antigen induced model of arthritis (AIA). Methods - Mice were injected with 5x105 UC-MSCs, or equivalent EVs from the same cell number, 24 hours post-arthritis induction. Cells were characterised by flow cytometry and EVs by Tunable Resistive Pulse Sensing (IZON) and cryo-electron microscopy following isolation using ultracentrifugation with a 30% sucrose cushion. Joint swelling was assessed over 72 hours, after which histological analysis was performed. Results - Cells displayed the expected phenotype markers for MSCs. EVs from 5x105 cells yielded 2.15x109 particles/ml with a mean size of 166±70nm, of which most particles displayed an EV-like morphology of a double lipid membrane bilayer.

Both approaches have shown limited success. The purpose of this study is to assess whether the introduction of autologous cells to commercial scaffolds using a fibrin gel delivery system might improve the synthetic meniscus approach. Methods and Materials - Medial and lateral menisci were harvested from n=5 sheep. Medial menisci were used to isolate meniscal cells from the avascular region, whilst punch defects (3mm) were created in lateral menisci and cylinders of Actifit® were inserted. Culture expanded avascular meniscal cells with progenitor characteristics were seeded into scaffolds with or without fibrin gel (including an acellular control). The explants were cultured in vitro for 28 days, after which GAG and DNA content were assessed, as well as type I collagen via immunohistochemistry. Results - Fibrin gel retained cells within the scaffolds and no detachment was observed between the meniscus tissue and scaffold at day 28. In contrast, in the cells without fibrin group, cells were observed streaming out of the scaffold onto plastic and meniscus tissue and scaffold detachment was observed at day 28. GAG and DNA analysis both showed that scaffolds with cells delivered by fibrin gel had higher values for both, compared to the cell only group (figure 1). Histological evaluation confirmed the presence of more collagen I in the fibrin and cells group. Conclusion - We have demonstrated the feasibility of using fibrin gel to deliver autologous meniscal progenitor cells from the avascular region into a clinical grade meniscus substitute in vitro. Cells delivered by fibrin gel showed increased retention and matrix production within the scaffold compared to cells directly seeded into the scaffold without fibrin. Our data is encouraging for the further development of a novel cell-based tissue engineering approach for meniscus replacement in the clinic.","tags":["Tissue engineering","Meniscus"],"title":"A novel Tissue Engineering Approach for Meniscus Replacement Evaluated Utilising an Ovine Explant Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charlotte Hulme","Sophie Bailey","Timothy Hopkins","Helen McCarthy","Ilyas Khan","Martyn Snow","Karina Wright","*SB and CHH joint first authors"],"categories":[],"content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n","date":1649635200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651751263,"objectID":"29a77d131283fb2ae6a5255262f47439","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/assessing-allogeneic-chondroprogenitor-manufacture-in-xeno-free-and-serum-free-media/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/assessing-allogeneic-chondroprogenitor-manufacture-in-xeno-free-and-serum-free-media/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose - Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (ACI) requires a cartilage harvest and a subsequent cell implantation. There is a need to move towards therapies which are less invasive for patients and more cost-effective for health service providers. Allogeneic cells are one potential solution, but in order to manufacture them, alternatives for the autologous serum currently used in ACI protocols must be sought. To future-proof this process, a move towards xeno-free and serum-free protocols is also needed. Methods and Materials - Chondroprogenitors were isolated from full depth human knee cartilage using selective adhesion to fibronectin and cryopreserved at passage 2-3 prior to use in these experiments. One ‘healthy’ cadaveric donor (a 22yo with no history of osteoarthritis/injury) and n=3 arthroplasty donors (mean 72yo) were included. Two xeno-free and serum-free GMP compliant culture media were tested for chondroprogenitors expanded on vitronectin (StemMacs MSC Expansion (media A; Miltenyi Biotech) and StemPro MSC Expansion (media B; Gibco)) cf. standard culture in DMEM/F12 with foetal bovine serum (FBS). Growth kinetics, immunoprofiling, gene expression analysis (RT-PCR) (n=4 donors) and chondrogenic analyses (n=2 donors) were performed for chondroprogenitors grown over passages 3 and 4. Results - Chondroprogenitor manufacture in xeno-free and serum-free media does not significantly impact on their growth kinetics (population doubling level), immunoprofile (CD90, 73, 105, 44, 49c, 151, 29, 19, 34, 45, 49b, 14, 49a, 39 and HLA-DR) and, crucially, chondrogenic potential (GAG/DNA content), compared to FBS supplemented cultures. When expressed relative to FBS cultures, SOX-9 was significantly higher in media A cf. media B at passage 3. No other differences were found between expression levels in media A cf. B for any of the other genes tested (COLII, ACAN, COLX and ALK-1). Conclusion - Our preliminary data suggests that xeno-free and serum-free media can be used to manufacture allogeneic chondroprogenitors without negatively altering their growth or phenotype.","tags":[],"title":"Assessing Allogeneic Chondroprogenitor Manufacture in Xeno-free and Serum-free Media","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Herman Kuiper","Adam Devany","Nilesh Makwana","Anup Pradhan","Caroline Lever","Patrick Laing","Sally Roberts","James Richardson"],"categories":[],"content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n","date":1649635200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651753679,"objectID":"e62b25d894a267140a5d68fdb9fe05d1","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/autologous-chondrocyte-implantation-in-osteochondral-defects-of-the-talus-two-to-fourteen-year-follow-up-study/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/autologous-chondrocyte-implantation-in-osteochondral-defects-of-the-talus-two-to-fourteen-year-follow-up-study/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose - Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) for treating talar osteochondral defects has given successful results in the short-term.

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are proposed to give BMAC its restorative properties. There are numerous methods of obtaining and concentrating bone marrow aspirate (BMA), and each method may alter the quantity and quality of MSCs in the final product. Here, we characterise the MSCs obtained from BMAC generated by one such commercial kit- complete cartilage regeneration (CCR), marketed by RegenGlobal. Methods and materials - BMAC obtained via the CCR kit during surgeries for patients with osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs) (n=10, aged 44±24 (Med±IQR), 6 female, 4 male) were directly plated on T25 flasks with 5ml complete media. After 24 hours adherence, cell culture flasks were washed with PBS and refreshed with complete media. Adherent cells were passaged after reaching up to 80% confluency and immunoprofiling (n=5) were performed. Results - BMAC samples from patients aged ≤40 (n=5, 3 female, 2 male) produced MSC colonies when plated, while BMAC from patients 40 (n=5, 3 female, 2 male), did not give rise to stably proliferating MSCs. All samples (n=5) at passages 0, 1 or 2 did not adhere to the MSC ISCT criteria for positive markers CD73 (n=4, 87.2±7.9), CD90 (n=2, 75.8±14.6), CD105 (n=2, 85.8±0.42) and negative marker CD14 (n=3, 27.7±16.5). All data are Mean±SD. Conclusion - These preliminary investigations indicate that patient age may change the quantity and quality of BMAC obtained. Moreover, there is a need to better assess the quality of the BMA used in these procedures, as well as better characterisation of both MSCs derived from BMAC and the other constituents of the BMAC product. Further investigation is needed as to how the MSCs behave when mixed with fibrin and hyaluronan scaffold, as is performed in this surgical technique.","tags":["Mesenchymal stromal cells","Bone marrow","BMAC"],"title":"Characterisation of mesenchymal stromal cells isolated from bone marrow aspirate concentrate","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Clare Thompson","Timothy Hopkins","Karina Wright","Martin Knight"],"categories":[],"content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n","date":1649635200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651751866,"objectID":"05382f0720af2d64cb3be485a54d7b15","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/development-of-a-human-synovial-joint-on-a-chip-model/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/development-of-a-human-synovial-joint-on-a-chip-model/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose - There is an unmet need for novel, disease-modifying pharmaceuticals for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA). The development of such therapeutics is hampered by a lack of physiologically relevant preclinical models, which contributes to significant attrition in the drug development pipeline. Organ-on-a-chip technology can be utilised to generate new in vitro models with a greater capacity to replicate human physiology in health and disease. Our aim is to develop an organ-on-a-chip model of the human synovial joint. Methods and Materials - A commercially available, two-channel, microfluidic chip (Chip-S1®, Emulate Inc) was used to develop the joint-on-a-chip model (Figure 1A). Primary human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) were cultured in the top channel within 10% Matrigel to replicate the intimal synovial lining layer, and primary human chondrocytes were cultured in the bottom channel within 2% agarose to mimic the articular cartilage (Figure 1A). After 24h, cell viability in the chip was assessed by live/dead (calcein AM/ethidium homodimer 1) staining. After 72 hours, cell morphology and cytoskeletal architecture was assessed by actin labelling. Results - FLS and chondrocyte viability was maintained at 24h (Figure 1B) and exhibited appropriate cytoskeletal architecture at 72h (Figure 2). Chondrocytes demonstrated a characteristic spherical morphology and were distributed evenly throughout the agarose. FLS were fibroblastic and formed a single layer of cells within the top channel of the chip, over the dividing membrane (Figure 2). Conclusion - The work presented here represents the early stages of development of a human synovial joint-on-a-chip and suggests that this model, built upon the Emulate Chip-S1®, is viable. Further validation of the model is currently ongoing. The Emulate system allows for the application of mechanical stimulation in the form of fluid shear and tensile strain and has numerous potential applications. For example, synovial inflammation can be mimicked through the addition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and drug (e.g. steroid) therapeutic efficacy can be screened.","tags":["Synovial Fluid","Joint-on-a-Chip Model"],"title":"Development of a Human Synovial Joint-on-a-Chip Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jade Perry","Claire Mennan","Paul Cool","Helen McCarthy","Karin Newell","Timothy Hopkins","Charlotte Hulme","Karina Wright","Frances Henson","Sally Roberts"],"categories":[],"content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n","date":1649635200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651750768,"objectID":"de3f9b871c5a4e719448ca743c1a0b9e","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/human-umbilical-cord-derived-mesenchymal-stromal-cells-reduce-radiographic-osteoarthritis-in-an-ovine-model/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/human-umbilical-cord-derived-mesenchymal-stromal-cells-reduce-radiographic-osteoarthritis-in-an-ovine-model/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose - This study investigated the effect of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hUC-MSCs) in an ovine model of early osteoarthritis (OA). Methods and Materials - Fourteen female, 3-4 year old Welsh Mountain sheep underwent medial meniscal transection in their left stifle joints. Four weeks post-surgery, 107 Quantum® bioreactor-culture expanded hUC-MSCs (pooled from 3 donors) in 50µL PBS (n=7) or PBS alone (n=7, vehicle control group) were injected into the knees. Joints were harvested 12-weeks post-surgery and underwent X-ray and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and histological processing. Scoring was performed via a macroscopic OA score, Kellgren-Lawrence score (X-ray), sMOAKS (whole joint on MRI) and pyKNEEr (cartilage thickness on MRI), and cartilage and synovitis histology scores (Table 1). Results - There was an improved macroscopic OA joint score in sheep receiving hUC-MSCs (11±4) cf. control (14±6), but this did not quite reach significance (p=0.054; Table 1). Kellgren-Lawrence X-ray scores in joints treated with hUC-MSCs were significantly improved (2.0±0) cf. control (3.0±0; p=0.028). No significant difference in sMOAKS (hUC-MSCs 18±10 vs. no cells 22±9; p=0.784) or PyKneer (hUC-MSCs 0.8±0.42mm vs. no cells 0.67±0.33mm; p=0.628) was observed between the treatment groups. Histological scoring demonstrated improved cartilage in sheep receiving hUC-MSCs (37±6) cf. control (41±13), but again, not quite significantly (p=0.064). A low level of synovitis was seen in both treatment groups (hUC-MSCs: 3.0±0.5 vs. no cells 3.0±2.5; p=0.900), i.e. typical of post-surgery, but with no increase caused by injecting xenogeneic cells. Conclusion - There was significantly less OA observed on X-rays in sheep treated with hUC-MSCs than vehicle control, with no indication of an inflammatory response to the cells at the time-point studied. Whilst corroborating suggestions from previous murine models of OA and injury, that hUC-MSCs have benefit as an allogeneic treatment for early OA, this study would perhaps have benefitted from an increase in numbers or timescale.","tags":["Mesenchymal stem cells","Osteoarthritis"],"title":"Human Umbilical Cord-Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Reduce Radiographic Osteoarthritis in an Ovine Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charlotte Hulme","John Garcia","Robert Freeman","Nigel Kiely","Derfel Williams","Jonathan Wright","Karina Wright"],"categories":[],"content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n","date":1649635200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651751092,"objectID":"d8bf1f7d93bb3c573d69822aa2cef123","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/juvenile-chondrocytes-novel-alternatives-for-allogeneic-cell-therapy/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/juvenile-chondrocytes-novel-alternatives-for-allogeneic-cell-therapy/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose - Development of novel allogeneic chondrocyte therapies are needed to provide a more widespread, cost-effective cartilage treatment option.

Macroscopic cartilage assessment by arthroscopy is commonly used to determine AC lesion severity prior to surgery. We previously reported that the health of the SB could influence outcomes following cell-based therapy for AC repair, but macroscopic assessment gives no indication of SB health. Our aim was to assess correlation between the macroscopic and histological grading systems.\nMethods and Materials - Osteochondral tissue samples were collected from patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery (TKR). AC was graded macroscopically using the ICRS Cartilage Lesion Classification System (grade 0 (normal) – grade 4 (severely abnormal)). Two osteochondral fragments, one with the lowest grade (most normal) and one with the highest grade (most abnormal) cartilage, were obtained for each TKR patient. Sections were stained with haematoxylin \u0026 eosin and safranin O/fast green before histological assessment. AC was graded using the OARSI OA Cartilage Histopathology Assessment System (grade 0 (normal) – grade 6 (deformation)). SB was graded using the SB Histological Grading System (grade 0 (early OA) – grade 3 (late-stage OA)). The relationship between scores was assessed using Kendall’s rank correlation coefficient (Kendall’s tau). Results - Sixteen TKR patients (6 female, 10 male; 68.2±6.7SD years-old), were included, resulting in the generation of 32 paired osteochondral fragments with the most normal and most abnormal cartilage for each patient. The ICRS score demonstrated moderate-to-strong correlation with both the AC and SB histological scores (Table 1, Figure 1). The AC and SB histological scores were also strongly correlated (Table 1). Conclusion - Our results suggest that macroscopic cartilage assessment, using the ICRS scoring system, may give an indication of histologically assessed AC and SB health. This study provides further evidence for the close association between the AC and SB in patients with established knee osteoarthritis.","tags":["Articular cartilage","Histology"],"title":"Macroscopic Assessment of Articular Cartilage Quality Correlates with Histological Assessment of Subchondral Bone Health","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karina Wright","Lauren Tierney","Mike Williams","Mateus Harrington","Jan Herman Kuiper","Peter Denis Gallacher","Paul Jermin","Martyn Snow","Sally Roberts"],"categories":[],"content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n","date":1649635200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651750606,"objectID":"e0204b676d4f4af0de88b292fa36c210","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/multilevel-modelling-of-longitudinal-outcome-data-20-years-post-autologous-chondrocyte-implantation/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/multilevel-modelling-of-longitudinal-outcome-data-20-years-post-autologous-chondrocyte-implantation/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose - Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) has been used to treat cartilage defects in the knee for over 25 years.

We have examined follow-up data from patients treated in our centre over the past two decades, the aim being to investigate demographic, injury and surgery/treatment-associated factors that can influence clinical outcome (via Lysholm score), following ACI in a large, “real-world”, non-uniform, longitudinally collected clinical data set. Methods and Materials - Multilevel (mixed) modelling was conducted using the programming language R. Of the 429 knee ACI procedures performed in our centre during the study period, 363 were suitable for model inclusion. All longitudinal post-operative Lysholm scores collected after ACI treatment and before a second procedure (such as knee arthroplasty but excluding minor procedures such as arthroscopy, debridement or biopsy for research) were included. Any patients requiring a bone graft at the time of ACI were also excluded. Potential predictors of ACI outcome explored in the model were age at the time of ACI, gender, smoker status, pre-operative Lysholm score, time from surgery, defect location, number of defects, patch type, previous operations, undergoing parallel procedure(s) at the time of ACI, cell count prior to implantation and cell passage number.

Stimulating meniscus regeneration through transplantation of meniscal progenitor cells has been proposed as a promising new strategy. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively phenotype regional progenitor populations in the human meniscus and donor-matched articular cartilage. Methods and Materials - Progenitor populations were isolated by selective adhesion to fibronectin from avascular and vascular regions of menisci and articular cartilage (n=5) harvested from human arthroplasty donors, as well as donor-matched whole mixed populations (no selective adhesion to fibronectin) for comparison. Growth kinetics and immunoprofiling were assessed at passage 0, and gene expression analysis and 3D pellet chondrogenic capacity were assessed at passage 2 for the different cell populations. Results - Fibronectin-selection resulted in populations resembling progenitors from the avascular and vascular menisci (PAvas and PVas, respectively) and also articular cartilage (PChs); these all demonstrated colony forming capacity on monolayer culture, whereas their mixed populations did not. PVas had a significant lower population doubling time cf. their vascular mixed counterparts. PVas also proliferated significantly faster than PAvas and PChs. Each progenitor cell population were significantly more immunopositivite for CD49b and CD49c cf. their mixed populations and PChs had a higher positivity level of CD166 compare to mixed chondrocytes. Collagen type I was upregulated and type II downregulated in progenitor pellets cf. mixed pellets. GAG/DNA analysis demonstrated that progenitor cells produced more GAGs per cell than mixed populations in all regions. Conclusion - Our study demonstrates that the human meniscus contains meniscal progenitor populations that retain colony forming capacity and have a distinct immunoprofile and matrix forming capacity in both the avascular and vascular regions. The findings of this study build on the body of evidence which suggests that meniscal progenitors represent attractive novel cell therapy populations for the enhancement of meniscal regeneration.","tags":[],"title":"Phenotypic Characterisation of Regional Human Meniscus Progenitor Cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martyn Snow"],"categories":[],"content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n","date":1649635200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651750271,"objectID":"0de4a1d0d50cc6915b8a71b5eb6d8c98","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/review-of-outcomes-surrounding-meniscal-allograft-transplantation/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/review-of-outcomes-surrounding-meniscal-allograft-transplantation/","section":"publication","summary":"Introduction - Meniscus transplantation is indicated for patients with a symptomatic meniscus deficient knee which is well aligned and stable. Initially MAT was indicated for patients with intact cartilage surfaces however the indications have been extended to include the treatment of instability and knees with greater degrees of chondral wear. Content - A recent Meta-analysis have reported that 85.8% of medial and 89.2% of lateral meniscal allograft transplants survive at midterm (5-10 years) while 52.6% of medial and 56.6% of lateral meniscal allograft transplants survive long term (10 years). Functional outcomes 10 years after MAT are fair and improved compared with preoperative scores. Patients undergoing lateral MAT have demonstrated greater pain relief and functional improvement than patients undergoing medial MAT. MAT is associated with a significant re-operation rate of up to 20% and patients need to be counselled accordingly. The majority (77%) of athletes and physically active patients are able to return to sport after MAT; approximately two-thirds are able to perform at preinjury levels. Most studies have reported no significant differences between the soft tissue suture and bone fixation in terms of meniscal allograft tear rates, failure rates, Lysholm scores, and VAS scores. Meniscal extrusion is also similar with both techniques. Associated malalignment and ligamentous instability should be corrected and overall, there seems to be no significant difference between the postoperative patient reported outcome scores in terms of isolated MAT and MAT combined with other procedures i.e. ligament reconstruction, osteotomy. However, more data is required to verify the effects of osteotomy and cartilage procedures on the clinical outcomes of MAT. More latterly the importance of the meniscus in knee instability has been appreciated and thus the potential role of MAT. Medial MAT has been shown to improve not only anteroposterior stability but also rotational stability in the meniscus-deficient ACL-reconstructed knee. Lateral MAT showed improvements in the anterior drawer and Lachman tests but not in the pivot-shift test or side-to-side difference on Telos stress radiographs in meniscus-deficient ACL-reconstructed knees. There is currently insufficient data within the literature to state whether MAT is chondroprotective or cost-effective. MAT needs to be approximately one-third more effective in delaying OA in previously meniscectomized knees to be considered cost-effective. Younger, non-obese patients have the lowest required efficacy of MAT to be cost-effective.","tags":[],"title":"Review of Outcomes Surrounding Meniscal Allograft Transplantation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Timothy Hopkins","Karina Wright","John Garcia","Jade Perry","Paul Jermin","Peter Denis Gallacher","Sally Roberts"],"categories":[],"content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n","date":1649635200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651753475,"objectID":"07cb125c14ed3309299292c11cc4f55b","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/severity-of-synovitis-and-macrophage-phenotypes-in-knee-cartilage-defect-and-osteoarthritis-cohorts/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/severity-of-synovitis-and-macrophage-phenotypes-in-knee-cartilage-defect-and-osteoarthritis-cohorts/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose - Growing evidence suggests that the synovium is important in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA).

The mean intensity of CD68, CD86 and CD206 immunostaining was also significantly higher in the cell therapy group cf. the arthroplasty group. The ratio of CD86 to CD206 was significantly higher in the cartilage injury synovia cf. OA synovia. Linear regression analysis of the full dataset indicated that CD86 intensity was a significant predictor of synovitis severity (cor.coeff.=0.052, p=0.016, 95% CI [0.036-0.234]). Conclusion - Increased synovitis, abundance of macrophages (CD68, CD86 and CD206 positive) and increased CD86:CD206 staining ratio (indicative of M1 favoured polarisation) in synovia from patients undergoing cell therapy for cartilage defects is suggestive of a macrophage-mediated, pro-inflammatory immune response. Whether this response relates to the harvest stage of cell therapy or cartilage defect pathology warrants further investigation. Conversely, the reduced abundance of macrophages in arthroplasty synovia suggests a reduced ability of the synovium to mount an immune response at the end-stage of OA, indicative of organ-level failure within the joint.","tags":["Knee","Cartilage defect","Macrophage"],"title":"Severity of Synovitis and Macrophage Phenotypes in Knee Cartilage Defect and Osteoarthritis Cohorts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martyn Snow"],"categories":[""],"content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n","date":1649635200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651749946,"objectID":"a32b76213c608ceab5a229d7f858a3e9","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/the-importance-of-aci-position-in-the-context-of-other-methods-unmet-needs-in-larger-defects/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/the-importance-of-aci-position-in-the-context-of-other-methods-unmet-needs-in-larger-defects/","section":"publication","summary":"Introduction - Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is an established technique for the treatment of cartilage lesions, particularly those greater than 2cm in size. Content - ACI is classified as an Advanced Medicinal Therapeutic Product (ATMP) and as such its use is associated with a significant regulatory and economic burden, which is the main barrier to use. Consequently, the indications for alternate techniques (usually confined to the treatment of smaller lesions) is extended e.g AMIC, or more latterly the use of osteochondral allograft (OCA) has increased. Based on the available literature, ACI is the only technique with level one evidence demonstrating short to mid-term clinical and cost-effectiveness for the treatment of chondral lesions. Thus, ACI should be considered as the first line treatment for chondral lesions greater than 2cm. The level of evidence available for the use of ACI in osteochondral lesions is more limited. The clinical effectiveness of ACI is known to be dependent on the integrity of subchondral bone, with inferior outcomes following previous microfracture. A number of case series have reported good outcomes with the use of ACI and bone graft (sandwich technique) for the treatment of osteochondritis dissecans, however no comparative studies currently exist. Large osteochondral lesions pose a significant clinical challenge, with some lesions unreconstructible with ACI. Excellent results for OCA have been reported for the treatment of osteochondral lesions out to 20years, however its use is largely limited by its availability. The chondrocyte viability of OCA grafts is predictive of clinical outcome, however concerns regarding the viability of grafts transported long distances from central tissue banks exist. Consequently, osteochondral lesions amenable to ACI should be treated with ACI and bone graft with OCA reserved for lesions unreconstructible with ACI or lesions known to have a poor prognosis e.g. previous microfracture.","tags":["Autologous chondrocyte implantation"],"title":"The Importance of ACI-Position in the context of other methods/unmet needs in larger defects","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sameera Abas","Jan Herman Kuiper","Sally Roberts","Helen McCarthy","Mike Williams","Andrew Bing","Bernhard Tins ","Nilesh Makwana"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\r","date":1646611200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646648559,"objectID":"c9cf019fea319a8893ae2cb133d2e49e","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/osteochondral-lesions-of-the-ankle-treated-with-bone-marrow-concentrate-with-hyaluronan-and-fibrin-a-single-centre-study/","publishdate":"2022-02-11T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/osteochondral-lesions-of-the-ankle-treated-with-bone-marrow-concentrate-with-hyaluronan-and-fibrin-a-single-centre-study/","section":"publication","summary":"Osteochondral defects of the ankle (OCD) are being increasingly identified as a clinically significant consequence of injury to the ankle, with the potential to lead to osteoarthritis if left untreated.

All EVs treatments reduced knee-joint swelling whilst only normoxic and pro-inflammatory primed EVs improved histopathological outcomes. In vitro culture with EVs did not achieve T cell deactivation. Polarisation towards CD4+ helper cells expressing IL17a (Th17) was reduced when normoxic and hypoxic EV treatments were applied in vitro. Normoxic EVs applied into the AIA model reduced Th17 polarisation and improved Regulatory T cell (Treg):Th17 homeostatic balance.

Three experimental groups were used: (i) hUC-MSCs, (ii) hBM-MSCs and (iii) PBS (vehicle) without cells.

Human BM-MSCs were isolated from two areas of subchondral bone in each of five osteochondral tissue specimens from five patients undergoing knee arthroplasty.

We also briefly refer to known syndecan-3 functions in other tissues and systems in an attempt to summarize the most up-to-date knowledge while also instilling curiosity about this extraordinary biomolecule and, hopefully, inspiring more research into its biochemistry and biological functions.","tags":["Syndecan-3","Muscle","Bone","Cartilage","Proteoglycans","Development","Regeneration","Stem Cells"],"title":"Syndecan-3: A Signaling Conductor in the Musculoskeletal System","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Methodology"],"content":"\r\rAs promised in the prior article on reproducible data analysis, here I’d like to outline the concept of version control, and how it pertains to reproducible research.\nVersion control is a method of recording changes made in a file or set of files over time, allowing you and/or your collaborators to track their history and easily review any changes.\rMany academics attempt a poor facsimile of this by using some flavour of “track changes” via software like Microsoft Word or Google docs, and emailing these documents back an forth with varying file names.\rParticularly with the use of Microsoft Word, this can lead to having lots of slightly different versions of the same file, with no easy way of knowing what version contains which changes, and who made them.\nMore advanced version control systems (VCS) such as Git, SVN and Mercurial provide more powerful and elegant tools.\rGit was originally designed for large groups of developers to work on big software projects, but is now used for many other kinds of projects.\nAs in the previous article, here is an overview of the benefits of using version control:\n\rThe process of creating work becomes more seamlessly integrated with organising, recording and disseminating said work, as opposed to additional burdens that may be neglected\rMore structured collaboration, with robust tools for asynchronous work and managing versions\rEasy creation of a web presence for a given project (this website is on GitHub!)\rIt can also serve as an excellent tool to support teaching\r\rMotivation\r\rFigure 1: A toy of the GitHub mascot. Image credit: Unslash\r\rVersion control allows us to understand the history of a piece of work (typically the writing of a paper for academics).\rThis lets us and others understand what was done, when, and with the aid of well written comments/commit messages, why it was done.\rThis greatly increases the transparency of the work, which is crucial for reproducibility.\rA version control system allows us to do this cleanly, with no debris from previous versions of files strewn about various folders which could confuse us or others trying to understand how we arrived at out final results.\rThis can be especially useful with code, as we no longer need to keep large chunks of unused code commented out just in case we want it later.\nBut perhaps the greatest benefit is the ease of collaboration good version control allows for.\rParticularly when combined with version control hosting services, such as GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket, version control allows many people, potential all over the world and in different time zones, to work on the same files.\rThe changes from different people can be tracked separately, and there are powerful tools communicate in a more structured way, via pull requests, code reviews and issues for example.\n\rBasic workflow\rA typical workflow using version control is as follows:\nCreate files - these should be plain text, usually code and/or markup or some kind\rWork on these files - adding, deleting or changing content\rCreate a snapshot - explicitly record the state of a file/s at that particular time, with a message summarising what was done\r\rIn Git, which I will focus on for the remainder of the article as it the most popular, these snapshots are called “commits”.\rThis can feel a little strange at first, but you quickly get used to it.\rPersonally, I’ve found a nice added benefit to using Git as a tool for delimitating where my day ends.\rThe last thing I do each day is commit all the work I’ve done, giving me a nice sense of accomplishment (or terrible shame if I’ve been unproductive…), and giving my brain a signal that work is over it’s time to switch gears.\n\rLearning resources\r\rFigure 2: Image credit: Unsplash\r\rIf I’ve managed to convince you to give version control a go then do be warned if you using Windows - getting things set up will be a bit ugly.\rWindows is a pretty terrible operating system for doing anything, but it’s especially bad for these kinds of things.\nIn an ideal world more people would realise that there are operating systems that you don’t have to pay for and don’t include spyware.\rI’m talking about Linux for the uninitiated.\rIf you’ve got an old clunker computer that’s unusably slow, try installing a lightweight Linux distribution and marvel at how much difference a good OS can make.\rWithout getting into some boring details, MacOS effectively has the same backbone as Linux, so that works well enough (but Linux is still way better!).\nThat’s not to say it can’t be done of course, especially with the help of these lovely resources:\n\rA great resource for many facets of reproducible research is The Turing Way\rAnother great resource, particularly for integrating Git with R is Happy Git with R\rThe Pro Git book is another great resource for a more in depth understanding of how Git works, and some of it’s more advanced features\r\r\r","date":1621555200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621604047,"objectID":"01055691cb9bef2dc8a9935a8f57180c","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/post/reproducible-research-version-control/","publishdate":"2021-05-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/reproducible-research-version-control/","section":"post","summary":"As promised in the prior article on reproducible data analysis, here I’d like to outline the concept of version control, and how it pertains to reproducible research.\nVersion control is a method of recording changes made in a file or set of files over time, allowing you and/or your collaborators to track their history and easily review any changes.","tags":["Reproducible Research","Methodology","Version Control","Git"],"title":"Reproducible Research -

We have examined the cells within SF of such joints by determining their chondrogenic capacity following culture expansion and establishing the phenotypes of the macrophage subsets in non-cultured cells. Design: Knee SF cells were obtained from 21 patients receiving cell therapy to treat a focal cartilage defect. Cell surface immunoprofiling for stem cell and putative chondrogenic markers, and the expression analysis of key chondrogenic and hypertrophic genes were conducted on culture-expanded SF cells prior to chondrogenesis. Flow cytometry was also used to determine the macrophage subsets in freshly isolated SF cells. Results: Immunoprofiling revealed positivity for the monocyte/macrophage marker (CD14), the haematopoietic/endothelial cell marker (CD34) and mesenchymal stem/stromal cell markers (CD73, CD90, CD105) on culture expanded cells. We found strong correlations between the presence of CD14 and the vascular cell adhesion marker, CD106 (r = 0.81, p = 0.003). Collagen type II expression after culture expansion positively correlated with GAG production (r = 0.73, p = 0.006), whereas CD90 (r = −0.6, p = 0.03) and CD105 (r = −0.55, p = 0.04) immunopositivity were inversely related to GAG production. Freshly isolated SF cells were positive for both pro- (CD86) and anti-inflammatory markers (CD163 and CD206). Conclusions: The cellular content of the SF from patients with focal cartilage injuries is comprised of a heterogeneous population of reparative and inflammatory cells. Additional investigations are needed to understand the role played by these cells in the attempted repair and inflammatory process in diseased joints.","tags":["Stem Cells"],"title":"The synovial fluid from patients with focal cartilage defects contains mesenchymal stem/stromal cells and macrophages with pro- and anti-inflammatory phenotypes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Garcia J","Roberts S","Tins B","Jermin P","Gallacher P","Kehoe O","Wright K","Stewart C","Kuiper JH"],"categories":[],"content":"\rWhen the cartilage in your joint is damaged, it is often thought that it does not heal and would eventually lead to joint degeneration.\rHowever, we have found evidence that in some instances, cartilage can repair itself without surgical intervention.\nWe studied this natural healing in patients who had an artificial cartilage defect created in their knees as part of a cell therapy trial.\rBiopsies of the regenerated cartilage tissues were taken about 12 months after the defect was created and examined in our lab to determine their quality and whether the tissues returned to their original structure.\rWhat we found showed that although the damaged cartilage did repair itself, it did not return to its normal structure, at least in that timescale.\rFor instance, collagens are very important molecules in cartilage, and we found that their organisation was different in the naturally repaired cartilage compared to normal.\rThis information is useful to us in that it may help to understand how we can improve ways of encouraging better repair tissue to form.\n","date":1619568000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619622143,"objectID":"9f86ddd00053e32540306dd94c5d9ced","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/project/spontaneous-healing-of-articular-cartilage-sharc/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/spontaneous-healing-of-articular-cartilage-sharc/","section":"project","summary":"Funded by the Medical Research Council (UKRI)","tags":["Arthritis","Clinical trial","Cartilage","Biology","Current projects"],"title":"A 12-month clinical study.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease in the world, but its onset and progression are still not fully understood.\rAlthough traditionally considered specifically a disease of the articular cartilage (AC), OA is now regarded as an ‘organ-level failure’ that affects and involves all tissues of the joint rather than the AC alone.\rOf these tissues, the subchondral bone (SB) is of particular interest given the close physical interaction and shared signalling pathways between the two tissues.\rIn this part of the project, a series of experiments are being performed to test if cells taken from healthy areas of the SB, and those taken from unhealthy areas of the SB, have different characteristics that could point to their involvement in OA (figure 2 and 3).\rSubsequently, we are investigating whether cells from these different regions have different effects on the characteristics of cells isolated from the cartilage (chondrocytes). This is carried out using a ‘co-culture’ model (figure 4), in which the cells from the SB and cells from the AC are grown together but separated by a membrane that prevents contact but allows communication between the cells.\rThe aim of this part of the project is to try and characterise the relationship between the AC and SB and the part that this relationship plays on the onset and progression of OA in the knee.\n\rFigure 1: Schematic illustrating the co-culture system of bone and cartilage cells.\r\rAnother part of this project is based in the clinic.\rA patient;s knee function is known to vary over their lifetime.\rHowever, there also appears to be variation over a more short-term basis, week-to-week or even day-to-day.\rOne factor thought to play a part in this variability is the patient’s activity levels.\rWe have recently shown, in a study of 64 patients undergoing rehabilitation following cell therapy, that the relationship between activity levels and knee function varies significantly between patients (a sample of these patients is shown in Figure 5).\rWe then sought to find factors that could explain this variation between patients.\rAffect, the feeling of emotion, is described in terms of positive and negative and is known to vary between patients and influence perceived disease symptoms.\rWe demonstrated that patients with a high positive affect score and low negative affect score are more likely to report improved knee function with increased activity levels and vice versa.\rThis has implications for the prescription of rehabilitation.

These are an attractive source of cells for regenerative medicine since they are fairly easy to obtain and grow and they also appear to have anti-inflammatory properties, which may be useful and make an immune reaction less likely if used in a different individual.\nWe are currently working with collaborators in other universities to see if the cells prepared here in Oswestry could delay osteoarthritis in their models.\rSpecifically, we are examining the effect of a single injection of UC-MSCs to determine if they can help repair or regenerate damaged joints.\rIf successful, it is likely they could be an excellent allogeneic (i.e. from another person) source of cells for the treatment of OA.\nOne of these (called the PMM or partial medial meniscectomy model) mimics end-stage osteoarthritis, with severe loss of cartilage and osteophyte formation appearing in the operated groups.\rOur results demonstrated that although the transplanted UC-MSCs did not recover joint damage induced by the PMM, as assessed histologically or by micro computed tomography (micro CT), the implanted cells did not appear to elicit an inflammatory response in the treated groups, even though they were from a different species (at least at the timepoints examined).\rFurthermore, there was marked variability between the UC donors, with a significantly reduced loss of joint space appearing at 12 weeks with one donor but not the other 2 donors’ cells. This suggests that some donors’ cells may have a greater therapeutic potential than others, highlighting the importance of characterising each batch of cells for allogeneic cell therapies.\nThe second model used a small isolated injury to the cartilage, which can lead to secondary osteoarthritis (and so significantly less severe than the aforementioned model).\rIn this injury model we compared human UC-MSCs and bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs, grown in a bioreactor (Quantum®), at repairing cartilage damage and preventing secondary OA.\rAs in the other study, the groups treated with cells did not appear to show any macroscopic or microscopic signs of swelling/inflammation due to human cell implantation.\rFurthermore, when assessed histologically both human MSC treated groups had significantly better repair compared with the untreated group (ie without cells; Figure 7).\rAdditionally, immunohistochemistry showed that there was more type II collagen in the repair tissue of those joints with better cartilage morphologically, as well as it containing many ‘tomato’-positive cells (which are derived from the joint interzone).\rThese results suggest that up-scale manufactured UC-MSCs and BM-MSCs could be an effective therapy for treating cartilage injuries.\rThe implanted MSCs did not appear to elicit an inflammatory response, further supporting their potential as an allogeneic treatment.\n","date":1619481600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619519095,"objectID":"c577a73a2e9c2a19a590818bbe1a9c63","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/project/can-cells-from-umbilical-cords-be-used-to-treat-patients-with-osteoarthritis/","publishdate":"2021-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/can-cells-from-umbilical-cords-be-used-to-treat-patients-with-osteoarthritis/","section":"project","summary":"Funded by Versus Arthritis and Keele University","tags":["Cartilage","Mesenchymal Stem Cells","Knee","Biology","Current projects"],"title":"Can cells from umbilical cords be used to treat patients with osteoarthritis?","type":"project"},{"authors":["Claire Mennan","Helen McCarthy","Daniel Tonge","Sally Roberts"],"categories":[],"content":"\rMesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) isolated from bone marrow (BM) are considered to be the “gold standard” for MSC populations which can be used for cell therapy.\rHowever, sourcing them can be painful and provide limited numbers of cells.

We have found, however, that different peoples’ cells can respond differently in how much IDO they produce.\nThis suggests that it would be important for cells destined for allogeneic cell banks to have their immunomodulatory potential tested prior to banking, to characterise the response to inflammatory cytokines for each donor.\nWe are working on using state of the art RNA-sequencing of the transcriptome of UC-MSC donors with either high or low response to inflammatory cytokines (as assessed via IDO gene expression).

Purpose: To identify novel biomarker candidates and to investigate the potential of a panel of protein biomarkers for the prediction of clinical outcome after treatment with microfracture or osteotomy. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: To identify novel candidate biomarker proteins, we used label-free quantitation after liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry of dynamic range-compressed synovial fluids (SFs) from individuals who responded excellently or poorly (based on change in Lysholm score) to microfracture (n = 6) or osteotomy (n = 7). Biomarkers that were identified in this proteomic analysis or that relate to osteoarthritis (OA) severity or have predictive value in another early OA therapy (autologous cell implantation) were measured in the SF of 19 and 13 patients before microfracture or osteotomy, respectively, using commercial immunoassays, and were normalized to urea. These were aggrecanase-1 (ADAMTS-4), cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), hyaluronan (HA), lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE-1), matrix metalloproteinase 1 and 3, soluble CD14, S100 calcium binding protein A13, and 14-3-3 protein theta (YWHAQ). Levels of COMP and HA were also measured in the plasma of these patients. To find predictors of postoperative function, multivariable regression analyses were performed. Results: Proteomic analyses highlighted YWHAQ and LYVE-1 as being differentially abundant between the clinical responders/improvers and nonresponders after microfracture. A linear regression model after backward variable selection could relate preoperative concentrations of SF proteins (HA, YWHAQ, LYVE-1), activity of ADAMTS-4, and patient demographic characteristics (smoker status and sex) with Lysholm score 12 months after microfracture. Further, a generalized linear model with elastic net penalization indicated that lower preoperative activity of ADAMTS-4 in SF, being a nonsmoker, and being younger at the time of operation were indicative of a higher postoperative Lysholm score (improved joint function) after osteotomy surgery. Conclusion: We have identified biomarkers and generated regression models with the potential to predict clinical outcome in patients treated with microfracture or osteotomy of the knee. Clinical Relevance: Candidate protein biomarkers identified in this study have the potential to help determine which patients will be best suited to treatment with microfracture or osteotomy.","tags":["Biomarkers","Synovial Fluid","Knee","Proteomics"],"title":"Identification of Candidate Synovial Fluid Biomarkers for the Prediction of Patient Outcome After Microfracture or Osteotomy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Garcia","Helen McCarthy","Jan Herman Kuiper","James Melrose","Sally Roberts"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\r","date":1610323200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646860877,"objectID":"6ccfaa422736427fe22b2a0f281952eb","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/perlecan-in-the-natural-and-cell-therapy-repair-of-human-adult-articular-cartilage-can-modifications-in-this-proteoglycan-be-a-novel-therapeutic-approach/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/perlecan-in-the-natural-and-cell-therapy-repair-of-human-adult-articular-cartilage-can-modifications-in-this-proteoglycan-be-a-novel-therapeutic-approach/","section":"publication","summary":"Articular cartilage is considered to have limited regenerative capacity, which has led to the search for therapies to limit or halt the progression of its destruction.

We investigated the immunolocalisation of perlecan and collagen between donor-matched biopsies of human articular cartilage defects (n = 10 × 2) that were repaired either naturally or using autologous cell therapy, and with age-matched normal cartilage. We explored how the removal of HS from perlecan affects human chondrocytes in vitro. Immunohistochemistry showed both a pericellular and diffuse matrix staining pattern for perlecan in both natural and cell therapy repaired cartilage, which related to whether the morphology of the newly formed tissue was hyaline cartilage or fibrocartilage. Immunostaining for perlecan was significantly greater in both these repair tissues compared to normal age-matched controls. The immunolocalisation of collagens type III and VI was also dependent on tissue morphology. Heparanase treatment of chondrocytes in vitro resulted in significantly increased proliferation, while the expression of key chondrogenic surface and genetic markers was unaffected. Perlecan was more prominent in chondrocyte clusters than in individual cells after heparanase treatment. Heparanase treatment could be a means of increasing chondrocyte responsiveness to cartilage injury and perhaps to improve repair of defects.","tags":["Human Articular Cartilage","Perlecan","Heparane sulfate","Heparanase","Cartilage repair","Chondrocyte"],"title":"Perlecan in the Natural and Cell Therapy Repair of Human Adult Articular Cartilage: Can Modifications in This Proteoglycan Be a Novel Therapeutic Approach?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tian Lan","Charlotte Hulme","Helen McCarthy","Karina Wright","Nilesh Makwana","Andrew Bing"],"categories":[],"content":"\rUntreated cartilage defects in the ankle can lead to osteoarthritis (OA).\rVarious versions of a cell therapy, using a one-step arthroscopic technique to deliver bone-marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) into a cartilage defect to delay the development of OA have been used in the ankle at RJAH.\rPreviously used to treat cartilage defects in the knee1, one such technique called Complete Cartilage Repair (CCR) has been used at RJAH for the treatment of cartilage defects in the ankle (n=62)2.\rPreliminary data from our laboratory using such patients BMAC samples have demonstrated that not all cells adhere to a traditional mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) phenotype, thus questioning the suggested mechanism of action.\rThis reverse-translational study aims to establish the exact cell population/s obtained via BMAC (in both commercially available normal and patient samples); we aim to assess their chondrogenic potency and phenotype and how these cells might relate to a good clinical outcome.\rFurthermore, we will aim to identify biomarkers within the synovial fluid and bloods which may predict which patients are most likely to benefit from this treatment.\nCommercially-available bone marrow aspirate from young, healthy donors will be concentrated via centrifugation using the three BMAC preparation kits trialled clinically in our centre (Complete Cartilage Repair (CCR), RegenGlobal; Heragen® Maxx, Heraeus; and Angel® BMC, Arthrex).\rFlow cytometry and qRT-PCR will be used to characterise the cell phenotype/s and assess their chondrogenic potency.\rAdditionally, how BMAC cells respond to the environment within the scaffold used in the CCR kit is unknown.\rTherefore, cells will be seeded within this scaffold in the laboratory and their viability and chondrogenic potency assessed by live/dead assays and qRT-PCR, respectively.\rSynovial fluid and bloods will be collected from patients at the time of BMAC (CCR) implantation and a panel of protein markers, found to predict clinical outcome following knee surgery3-5, will be assessed to identify proteins that may predict clinical outcome following treatment.\rAt 6 and 12 months post-treatment, clinical outcome and general well-being of the patients enrolled in this study will be assessed using a validated foot and ankle questionnaire (MOXFQ) and the EQ5D questionnaire, respectively.\nThe comparison of the three different preparation kits will indicate which preparation yields the most suitable cell type/s for cartilage repair.\rThis will provide clinically relevant information which could contribute to a clinical trial application and for seeking more substantive scientific funding.\n","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620825023,"objectID":"47bede877982298fc6f6a8ef2fce2520","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/project/cell-therapy-for-repair-of-cartilage-defects-in-the-ankle-how-does-it-work-and-who-should-we-treat/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cell-therapy-for-repair-of-cartilage-defects-in-the-ankle-how-does-it-work-and-who-should-we-treat/","section":"project","summary":"Funded by the Orthopaedic Institute","tags":["Ankle","Cell therapy","Biomarkers","Mesenchymal Stem Cells","Biology","Current projects"],"title":"Cell therapy for repair of cartilage defects in the ankle - how does it work and who should we treat?","type":"project"},{"authors":["Anaïs Makos","Jan Herman Kuiper","Roshan Amarasena","Oksana Keohe"],"categories":[],"content":"\rPsoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease\rand patients suffer from joint and spinal pain because of immune cell\rinfiltration and expansion in skin and synovium.

MSCs isolated from bone marrow of wild type and Sdc3−/− mice were used to assess immunophenotype, differentiation, adhesion and migration properties and cell signalling pathways. While both cell types show similar differentiation potential and forward scatter values, the cell complexity in wild type MSCs was significantly higher than in Sdc3−/− cells and was accompanied by lower spread surface area. Moreover, Sdc3−/− MSCs adhered more rapidly to collagen type I and showed a dramatic increase in AKT phosphorylation, accompanied by a decrease in ERK1/2 phosphorylation compared with control cells. In a mouse model of antigen-induced inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular injection of Sdc3−/− MSCs yielded enhanced efficacy compared to injection of wild type MSCs. In conclusion, our data suggest that syndecan-3 regulates MSC adhesion and efficacy in inflammatory arthritis, likely via induction of the AKT pathway.","tags":["Rheumatoid Arthritis","Extracellular matrix"],"title":"Syndecan-3 regulates MSC adhesion, ERK and AKT signalling in vitro and its deletion enhances MSC efficacy in a model of inflammatory arthritis in vivo","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jade Perry","Helen McCarthy","George Bou-Gharios","Robert van 't Hof","Paul Milner","Claire Mennan","Sally Roberts"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\r","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646852176,"objectID":"4268bea2ddcda4d04fc01546415e3558","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/injected-human-umbilical-cord-derived-mesenchymal-stromal-cells-do-not-appear-to-elicit-an-inflammatory-response-in-a-murine-model-of-osteoarthritis/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/injected-human-umbilical-cord-derived-mesenchymal-stromal-cells-do-not-appear-to-elicit-an-inflammatory-response-in-a-murine-model-of-osteoarthritis/","section":"publication","summary":"Objective - This study investigated the effect of hUC-MSCs on osteoarthritis (OA) progression in a xenogeneic model.

A no cell control group was also used (n = 29). All knee joints were assessed via micro-computed tomography (μCT) and histology and 10 plasma markers were analysed at 12 weeks. Results - PMM resulted in cartilage loss and osteophyte formation resembling human OA at both time-points. Injection of one donor's hUC-MSCs into the joint significantly reduced the loss of joint space at 12 weeks post-operatively compared with the PMM control. This effective population of MSCs up-regulated the genes, IDO and TSG6, when stimulated with inflammatory cytokines, more than those from the other two donors.No evidence of an inflammatory response to the injected cells in any animals, either histologically or with plasma biomarkers, arose. Conclusion - Beneficial change in a PMM joint was seen with only one hUC-MSC population, perhaps indicating that cell therapy is not appropriate for severely osteoarthritic joints. However, none of the implanted cells appeared to elicit an inflammatory response at the time-points studied. The variability of UC donors suggests some populations may be more therapeutic than others and donor characterisation is essential in developing allogeneic cell therapies.","tags":["Allogeneic cell therapy","Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells","osteoarthritis","Preclinical model"],"title":"Injected human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells do not appear to elicit an inflammatory response in a murine model of osteoarthritis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mairead Hyland","Claire Mennan","Emma Wilson","Aled Clayton","Oksana Kehoe"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\r","date":1584316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646863038,"objectID":"8bb3890060ea5e20d2a67bc47f76cc69","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/pro-inflammatory-priming-of-umbilical-cord-mesenchymal-stromal-cells-alters-the-protein-cargo-of-their-extracellular-vesicles/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pro-inflammatory-priming-of-umbilical-cord-mesenchymal-stromal-cells-alters-the-protein-cargo-of-their-extracellular-vesicles/","section":"publication","summary":"Umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells (UCMSCs) have shown an ability to modulate the immune system through the secretion of paracrine mediators, such as extracellular vesicles (EVs).

EVs were isolated from UCMSC conditioned media and characterised based on size, morphology and surface marker expression. EV protein cargo was analysed using a proximity-based extension assay. Results showed that EVs had a similar size and morphology.

Here, it binds pro-inflammatory chemokines with evidence for a role in chemokine presentation and leukocyte trafficking into the joint, promoting the inflammatory response. In this study, we explored the role of soluble syndecan-3 as a binder of chemokines and as an anti-inflammatory and therapeutic molecule. Methods - A human monocytic cell line and CD14+ PBMCs were utilised in both Boyden chamber and trans-endothelial migration assays. Soluble syndecan-3 was tested in antigen-induced and collagen-induced in vivo arthritis models in mice. ELISA and isothermal fluorescence titration assays assessed the binding affinities. Syndecan-3 expression was identified by flow cytometry and PCR, and levels of shedding by ELISA. Results - Using in vitro and in vivo models, soluble syndecan-3 inhibited leukocyte migration in vitro in response to CCL7 and its administration in murine models of rheumatoid arthritis reduced histological disease severity. Using isothermal fluorescence titration, the binding affinity of soluble syndecan-3 to inflammatory chemokines CCL2, CCL7 and CXCL8 was determined, revealing little difference, with Kds in the low nM range. TNFα increased cell surface expression and shedding of syndecan-3 from cultured human endothelial cells. Furthermore, soluble syndecan-3 occurred naturally in the sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis, and its levels correlated with syndecan-1. Conclusions - This study shows that the addition of soluble syndecan-3 may represent an alternative therapeutic approach in inflammatory disease.","tags":["Syndecan-3","Cell migration","Therapeutic","Chemokine","Animal model"],"title":"Soluble syndecan-3 binds chemokines, reduces leukocyte migration in vitro and ameliorates disease severity in models of rheumatoid arthritis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Claire Mennan","John Garcia","Sally Roberts","Charlotte Hulme","Karina Wright"],"categories":[],"content":"\r\r","date":1552867200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620136733,"objectID":"889ef4c2fb23be9148448cbf9b7b00f4","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/a-comprehensive-characterisation-of-large-scale-expanded-human-bone-marrow-and-umbilical-cord-mesenchymal-stem-cells/","publishdate":"2019-03-18T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/a-comprehensive-characterisation-of-large-scale-expanded-human-bone-marrow-and-umbilical-cord-mesenchymal-stem-cells/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: The manufacture of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) for clinical use needs to be cost effective, safe and scaled up. Current methods of expansion on tissue culture plastic are labour-intensive and involve several ‘open’ procedures. We have used the closed Quantum® hollow fibre bioreactor to expand four cultures each of MSCs derived from bone marrow (BM) and, for the first time, umbilical cords (UCs) and assessed extensive characterisation profiles for each, compared to parallel cultures grown on tissue culture plastic. Methods: Bone marrow aspirate was directly loaded into the Quantum®, and cells were harvested and characterised at passage (P) 0. Bone marrow cells were re-seeded into the Quantum®, harvested and further characterised at P1. UC-MSCs were isolated enzymatically and cultured once on tissue culture plastic, before loading cells into the Quantum®, harvesting and characterising at P1. Quantum®-derived cultures were phenotyped in terms of immunoprofile, tri-lineage differentiation, response to inflammatory stimulus and telomere length, as were parallel cultures expanded on tissue culture plastic. Results: Bone marrow cell harvests from the Quantum® were 23.1±16.2×106 in 14±2days (P0) and 131±84×106 BM-MSCs in 13±1days (P1), whereas UC-MSC harvests from the Quantum® were 168±52×106 UC-MSCs after 7±2days (P1). Quantum®- and tissue culture plastic-expanded cultures at P1 adhered to criteria for MSCs in terms of cell surface markers, multipotency and plastic adherence, whereas the integrins, CD29, CD49c and CD51/61, were found to be elevated on Quantum®-expanded BM-MSCs. Rapid culture expansion in the Quantum® did not cause shortened telomeres when compared to cultures on tissue culture plastic. Immunomodulatory gene expression was variable between donors but showed that all MSCs upregulated indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO). Conclusions: The results presented here demonstrate that the Quantum® can be used to expand large numbers of MSCs from bone marrow and umbilical cord tissues for next-generation large-scale manufacturing, without impacting on many of the properties that are characteristic of MSCs or potentially therapeutic. Using the Quantum®, we can obtain multiple MSC doses from a single manufacturing run to treat many patients. Together, our findings support the development of cheaper cell-based treatments.","tags":["Umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells"],"title":"A comprehensive characterisation of large-scale expanded human bone marrow and umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chelsea Rheannon Wood","Douaa Al Dhahri","Ibtesam Al Delfi","Neil Anthony Pickles","Rachel Sammons","Tony Worthington","Karina Wright","William Eustace Basil Johnson"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\r","date":1540252800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647342867,"objectID":"08daa42435693364803e618587404f13","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/human-adipose-tissue-derived-mesenchymal-stem-stromal-cells-adhere-to-and-inhibit-the-growth-of-staphylococcus-aureus-and-pseudomonas-aeruginosa/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/human-adipose-tissue-derived-mesenchymal-stem-stromal-cells-adhere-to-and-inhibit-the-growth-of-staphylococcus-aureus-and-pseudomonas-aeruginosa/","section":"publication","summary":"We have cultured and phenotyped human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (AT MSCs) and inoculated these cultures with bacteria common to infected skin wounds, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The quality of repair tissue formed 1 year after autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) in the knee was analyzed and compared with clinical outcomes over time. Hypothesis - Better quality repair tissue and a better appearance on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 1 year after ACI lead to improved longer-term clinical outcomes. Study design - Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods - Repair tissue quality was assessed using either MRI (11.5 ± 1.4 [n = 91] or 39.2 ± 18.5 [n = 76] months after ACI) or histology (16.3 ± 11.0 months [n = 102] after ACI). MRI scans were scored using the whole-organ magnetic resonance imaging score (WORMS) and the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score, with additional assessments of subchondral bone marrow and cysts. Histology of repair tissue was performed using the Oswestry cartilage score (OsScore) and the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) II score. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the modified Lysholm score preoperatively, at the time of MRI or biopsy, and at a mean 8.4 ± 3.7 years (maximum, 17.8 years) after ACI. Results - At 12 months, the total MOCART score and some of its individual parameters correlated significantly with clinical outcomes. The degree of defect fill, overall signal intensity, and surface of repair tissue at 12 months also significantly correlated with longer-term outcomes. The presence of cysts or effusion (WORMS) significantly correlated with clinical outcomes at 12 months, while the presence of synovial cysts/bursae preoperatively or the absence of loose bodies at 12 months correlated significantly with long-term clinical outcomes. Thirty percent of repair tissue biopsies contained hyaline cartilage, 65% contained fibrocartilage, and 5% contained fibrous tissue. Despite no correlation between the histological scores and clinical outcomes at the time of biopsy, a lack of hyaline cartilage or poor basal integration was associated with increased pain; adhesions visible on MRI also correlated with significantly better histological scores. Conclusion - These results demonstrate that MRI at 12 months can predict longer-term clinical outcomes after ACI. Further investigation regarding the presence of cysts, effusion, and adhesions and their relationship with histological and clinical outcomes may yield new insights into the mechanisms of cartilage repair and potential sources of pain.","tags":["Articular cartilage","Histology","Imaging","Knee","Magnetic Resonance Imaging"],"title":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Parameters at 1 Year Correlate With Clinical Outcomes Up to 17 Years After Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charlotte Hulme","Emma L.

We previously used label-free quantitation (LF) with a dynamic range compression proteomic approach to assess the synovial fluid (SF) of ACI responders and non-responders. However, we were able to identify only a few differentially abundant proteins at baseline. In the present study, we built upon these previous findings by assessing higher-abundance proteins within this SF, providing a more global proteomic analysis on the basis of which more of the biology underlying ACI success or failure can be understood.\nMethods: Isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) proteomic analysis was used to assess SF from ACI responders (mean Lysholm improvement of 33; *n=14*) and non-responders (mean Lysholm decrease of 14; *n=13*) at the two stages of surgery (cartilage harvest and chondrocyte implantation).

Leukocytes are guided throughout this process by chemokines. These are basic proteins that interact with leukocytes to initiate their activation and extravasation via chemokine receptors. This is enabled through chemokine immobilization by glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) at the luminal endothelial surface of blood vessels. A specific stretch of basic amino acids on the chemokine, often at the C terminus, interacts with the negatively charged GAGs, which is considered an essential interaction for the chemokine function. Short-chain peptides based on this GAG-binding region of the chemokines CCL5, CXCL8, and CXCL12γ were synthesized using standard Fmoc chemistry. These peptides were found to bind to GAGs with high affinity, which translated into a reduction of leukocyte migration across a cultured human endothelial monolayer in response to chemokines. The leukocyte migration was inhibited upon removal of heparan sulfate from the endothelial surface and was found to reduce the ability of the chemokine and peptide to bind to endothelial cells in binding assays and to human rheumatoid arthritis tissue. The data suggest that the peptide competes with the wild-type chemokine for binding to GAGs such as HS and thereby reduces chemokine presentation and subsequent leukocyte migration. Furthermore, the lead peptide based on CXCL8 could reduce the disease severity and serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α in a murine Ag-induced arthritis model. Taken together, evidence is provided for interfering with the chemokine-GAG interaction as a relevant therapeutic approach.","tags":[],"title":"Novel Anti-Inflammatory Peptides Based on Chemokine-Glycosaminoglycan Interactions Reduce Leukocyte Migration and Disease Severity in a Model of Rheumatoid Arthritis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Claire Mennan","John Garcia","Helen McCarthy","Sharon Owen","Jade Perry","Karina Wright","Robin Banerjee","James Richardson","Sally Roberts"],"categories":[],"content":"\r\r","date":1524096000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646850592,"objectID":"c9450e6e44d09a42983778078cfa93ce","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/human-articular-chondrocytes-retain-their-phenotype-in-sustained-hypoxia-while-normoxia-promotes-their-immunomodulatory-potential/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/human-articular-chondrocytes-retain-their-phenotype-in-sustained-hypoxia-while-normoxia-promotes-their-immunomodulatory-potential/","section":"publication","summary":"Objective - To assess the phenotype of human articular chondrocytes cultured in normoxia (21% O2) or continuous hypoxia (2% O2).

Rats underwent either medial meniscal transection (MNX) or sham surgery under anaesthesia.

Synovial inflammation is a major feature of RA and is associated with leukocyte recruitment. Leukocytes cross the endothelial cells (ECs) into the synovial tissue and fluid and this migration is mediated via a range of chemokines and adhesion molecules on the ECs. As important mediators of leukocyte extravasation, a number of chemokines from each of the chemokine families have been established as expressed in the RA joint. However, as little information is available on which chemokines are expressed/presented by the ECs themselves, the purpose of the study was to ascertain which of the CC chemokines were localised in RA ECs. Immunofluoresence was used to assess the presence of the CC-family chemokines in RA synovial ECs using von-Willebrand factor (VWF) as a pan-endothelial marker and a range of human chemokine antibodies. The percentage of VWF positive vessels which were positive for the chemokines was determined. The presence of the four most highly expressed novel chemokines were further investigated in non-RA synovial ECs and the sera and synovial fluid (SF) from patients with RA and osteoarthritis (OA). Statistical analysis of immunofluorescence data was carried out by Student's t-test. For analysis of ELISA data, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA followed by Dunn's multiple comparison test was utilised to analyse differences in sera and SF levels for each chemokine between RA and OA. Spearman rank correlations of sera and SF chemokine levels with a range of clinical variables were also performed. Chemokine detection varied, the least abundant being CCL27 which was present in 8.3% of RA blood vessels and the most abundant being CCL19 which was present in 80%. Of the 26 chemokines studied, 19 have not been previously observed in RA ECs. Four of these novel chemokines, namely CCL7, CCL14, CCL16 and CCL22 were present on ≥60% of vessels. CCL14 and CCL22 were shown to be increased in RA ECs compared to non-RA ECs, p=0.0041 and p=0.014 respectively.

However, we are yet to understand fully why some individuals do not respond well to this intervention. Identification of a reliable and accurate biomarker panel that can predict which patients are likely to respond well to ACI is needed in order to assign the patient to the most appropriate therapy. This study aimed to compare the baseline and mid-treatment proteomic profiles of synovial fluids (SFs) obtained from responders and non-responders to ACI. Methods: SFs were derived from 14 ACI responders (mean Lysholm improvement of 33 (17–54)) and 13 non-responders (mean Lysholm decrease of 14 (4–46)) at the two stages of surgery (cartilage harvest and chondrocyte implantation). Label-free proteome profiling of dynamically compressed SFs was used to identify predictive markers of ACI success or failure and to investigate the biological pathways involved in the clinical response to ACI. Results: Only 1 protein displayed a ≥2.0-fold differential abundance in the preclinical SF of ACI responders versus non-responders. However, there is a marked difference between these two groups with regard to their proteome shift in response to cartilage harvest, with 24 and 92 proteins showing ≥2.0-fold differential abundance between Stages I and II in responders and non-responders, respectively. Proteomic data has been uploaded to ProteomeXchange (identifier: PXD005220). We have validated two biologically relevant protein changes associated with this response, demonstrating that matrix metalloproteinase 1 was prominently elevated and S100 calcium binding protein A13 was reduced in response to cartilage harvest in non-responders. Conclusions: The differential proteomic response to cartilage harvest noted in responders versus non-responders is completely novel. Our analyses suggest several pathways which appear to be altered in non-responders that are worthy of further investigation to elucidate the mechanisms of ACI failure. These protein changes highlight many putative biomarkers that may have potential for prediction of ACI treatment success.","tags":["Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation","Proteomics"],"title":"Autologous chondrocyte implantation-derived synovial fluids display distinct responder and non-responder proteomic profiles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["James Richardson","Karina Wright","Johanna Wales","Jan Herman Kuiper","Helen McCarthy","Peter Gallacher","Paul Harrison","Sally Roberts"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\r","date":1498003200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646850171,"objectID":"07adfd7b033bd1c466e9a7cfb2b94217","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/efficacy-and-safety-of-autologous-cell-therapies-for-knee-cartilage-defects-autologous-stem-cells-chondrocytes-or-the-two-randomized-controlled-trial-design/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/efficacy-and-safety-of-autologous-cell-therapies-for-knee-cartilage-defects-autologous-stem-cells-chondrocytes-or-the-two-randomized-controlled-trial-design/","section":"publication","summary":"Aim - The main aim of this trial is to test the safety and efficacy of autologous stromal/stem cells, chondrocytes or the two combined in the treatment of knee cartilage defects.

Several demographic and injury-specific risk factors have been identified that can affect the success of ACI treatment. However, the discovery of predictive biomarkers in this field has thus far been overlooked. Purpose - To identify potential biomarkers in synovial fluid and plasma that can be used in the preoperative setting to help optimize patient selection for cell-based cartilage repair strategies. Study Design - Controlled laboratory study. Methods - Fifty-four ACI-treated patients were included. Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), hyaluronan, soluble CD14 levels, and aggrecanase-1 (ADAMTS-4) activity in synovial fluid and COMP and hyaluronan in plasma were measured. Baseline and postoperative functional outcomes were determined using the patient-reported Lysholm score. To find predictors of postoperative function, linear and logistic regression analyses were performed. The dependent variables were the baseline and postoperative Lysholm score; the independent variables were patient age and body mass index, defect location, defect area, having a bone-on-bone defect, type of defect patch (periosteum or collagen), requirement of an extra procedure, and baseline biomarker levels. Results - The mean baseline Lysholm score was 47.4 ± 17.0, which improved to 64.6 ± 21.7 postoperatively. The activity of ADAMTS-4 in synovial fluid was identified as an independent predictor of the postoperative Lysholm score. Indeed, simply the presence or absence of ADAMTS-4 activity in synovial fluid appeared to be the most important predictive factor. As determined by contingency analysis, when ADAMTS-4 activity was detectable, the odds of being a responder were 3 times smaller than when ADAMTS-4 activity was not detectable. Other predictive factors were the baseline Lysholm score, age at ACI, and defect patch type used. Conclusion - The absence of ADAMTS-4 activity in the synovial fluid of joints with cartilage defects may be used in conjunction with known demographic risk factors in the development of an ACI treatment algorithm to help inform the preclinical decision.","tags":["Knee","Articular cartilage","Autologous chondrocyte implantation","Predictive biomarkers","Synovial Fluid"],"title":"The Absence of Detectable ADAMTS-4 (Aggrecanase-1) Activity in Synovial Fluid Is a Predictive Indicator of Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation Success","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alasdair G.

Objectives - The identification of prognostic biomarkers of spinal cord injury (SCI) will help to assign SCI patients to the correct treatment and rehabilitation regimes. Further, the detection of biomarkers that predict permanent neurological outcome would aid in appropriate recruitment of patients into clinical trials. The objective of this review is to evaluate the current state-of-play in this developing field. Setting - Studies from multiple countries were included. Methods - We have completed a comprehensive review of studies that have investigated prognostic biomarkers in either the blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of animals and humans following SCI. Results - Targeted and unbiased approaches have identified several prognostic biomarkers in CSF and blood. These proteins associate with cellular damage following SCI and include components from neurons, oligodendrocytes and reactive astrocytes, that is, neurofilament proteins, glial fibrillary acidic protein, Tau and S100 calcium-binding protein β. Unbiased approaches have also identified microRNAs that are specific to SCI, as well as other cell damage-associated proteins. Conclusions - The discovery and validation of stable, specific, sensitive and reproducible biomarkers of SCI is a rapidly expanding field of research. So far, few studies have utilised unbiased approaches aimed at the discovery of biomarkers within the CSF or blood in this field; however, some targeted approaches have been successfully used. Several studies using various animal models and some with small human patient cohorts have begun to pinpoint biomarkers in the CSF and blood with putative prognostic value. An increased sample size will be required to validate these biomarkers in the heterogeneous clinical setting.","tags":[],"title":"The developing landscape of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for spinal cord injury in cerebrospinal fluid and blood","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Garcia","Claire Mennan","Helen McCarthy","Sally Roberts","James Richardson","Karina Wright"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\r","date":1475452800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646849800,"objectID":"b5e68d068e1b681c82b56924504ef1dd","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/chondrogenic-potency-analyses-of-donor-matched-chondrocytes-and-mesenchymal-stem-cells-derived-from-bone-marrow-infrapatellar-fat-pad-and-subcutaneous-fat/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chondrogenic-potency-analyses-of-donor-matched-chondrocytes-and-mesenchymal-stem-cells-derived-from-bone-marrow-infrapatellar-fat-pad-and-subcutaneous-fat/","section":"publication","summary":"Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is a cell-based therapy that has been used clinically for over 20 years to treat cartilage injuries more efficiently in order to negate or delay the need for joint replacement surgery.

In this study, we have tested the chondrogenic potential of donor-matched MSCs derived from bone marrow (BM), infrapatellar fat pad (FP), and subcutaneous fat (SCF), compared to chondrocytes. We have confirmed that there is a chondrogenic potency hierarchy ranging across these cell types, with the most potent being chondrocytes, followed by FP-MSCs, BM-MSCs, and lastly SCF-MSCs. We have also examined gene expression and surface marker profiles in a predictive model to identify cells with enhanced chondrogenic potential. In doing so, we have shown that Sox-9, Alk-1, and Coll X expressions, as well as immunopositivity for CD49c and CD39, have predictive value for all of the cell types tested in indicating chondrogenic potency.

These MSC appear to be immune privileged and are promising candidates for cell therapy. However, isolating MSC from WJ, artery, vein or cord lining requires time-consuming tissue dissection. MSC can be obtained easily via briefly digesting complete segments of the umbilical cord, likely containing heterogenous or mixed populations of MSC (MC-MSC). MC-MSC are generally less well characterized than WJ-MSC, but nevertheless represent a potentially valuable population of MSC. This study aimed to further characterize MC-MSC in comparison to WJ-MSC and also the better-characterized bone marrow-derived MSC (BM-MSC). MC-MSC proliferated faster, with significantly faster doubling times reaching passage one 8.8 days sooner and surviving longer in culture than WJ-MSC. All MSC retained the safety aspect of reducing telomere length with increasing passage number. MSC were also assessed for their ability to suppress T-cell proliferation and for the production of key markers of pluripotency, embryonic stem cells, tolerogenicity (CD40, CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR) and immunomodulation (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase [IDO] and HLA-G). The MC-MSC population displayed all of the positive attributes of WJ-MSC and BM-MSC, but they were more efficient to obtain and underwent more population doublings than from WJ, suggesting that MC-MSC are promising candidates for allogeneic cell therapy in regenerative medicine.","tags":["allogeneic cell therapy","bone marrow‐derived mesenchymal stromal cells","immunomodulation","umbilical cord‐derived mesenchymal stromal cells"],"title":"Mesenchymal stromal cells derived from whole human umbilical cord exhibit similar properties to those derived from Wharton's jelly and bone marrow","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Garcia","Karina Wright","Sally Roberts","Jan Herman Kuiper","Chas Mangham","James Richardson","Claire Mennan"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\r","date":1460505600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647344788,"objectID":"0bc105ea99c1aa783351a5d5c1edc94a","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/characterisation-of-synovial-fluid-and-infrapatellar-fat-pad-derived-mesenchymal-stromal-cells-the-influence-of-tissue-source-and-inflammatory-stimulus/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/characterisation-of-synovial-fluid-and-infrapatellar-fat-pad-derived-mesenchymal-stromal-cells-the-influence-of-tissue-source-and-inflammatory-stimulus/","section":"publication","summary":"The infrapatellar fat pad (FP) and synovial fluid (SF) in the knee serve as reservoirs of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) with potential therapeutic benefit.

Both cell populations were positive for MSC markers CD73, CD90 and CD105 and displayed multipotency. FP-MSCs had a significantly faster proliferation rate than SF-MSCs. CD14 positivity was seen in both FP-MSCs and SF-MSCs and was positively correlated to donor age but only for SF-MSCs.

The immunomodulatory molecule, HLA-G, was constitutively produced by both cell populations, unlike indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase which was only produced following IFN-γ stimulation.

Purpose - To evaluate the outcome of simultaneous transplantation of an autologous bone plug with first- or second-generation ACI for restoration of concomitant subchondral bone and full-thickness cartilage defect in the femoral condyle of the knee. Study design - Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods - Seventeen patients (mean ± SD age, 27 ± 7 years; range, 17-40 years)-12 with osteochondritis dissecans (International Cartilage Repair Society [ICRS] grades 3 and 4) and 5 with an isolated osteochondral defect (ICRS grade 4)-had the defect reconstructed with implantation of a unicortical autologous bone graft combined with ACI (the OsPlug technique). Functional outcome was assessed with Lysholm scores obtained preoperatively and at 1 and 5 years postoperatively. The repair site was evaluated with the Oswestry Arthroscopy Score (OAS), MOCART score (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue), and ICRS II histology score. Formation of a subchondral lamina and lateral integration of the bone grafts were evaluated from magnetic resonance imaging scans. Results - The mean defect size was 4.5 ± 2.6 cm(2) (range, 1-9 cm(2)), and the mean depth was 11.3 ± 5 mm (range, 5-18 mm). The preoperative Lysholm score improved from 45 (interquartile range [IQR], 24; range, 16-79) to 77 (IQR, 28; range, 41-100) at 1 year (P = .001) and 70 (IQR, 35; range, 33-91) at 5 years (P = .009). The mean OAS of the repair site was 6.2 (range, 0-9) at a mean of 1.3 years. The mean MOCART score was 61 ± 22 (range, 20-85) at 2.6 ± 1.8 years. Histology demonstrated generally good integration of the repair cartilage with the underlying bone. Poor lateral integration of the bone graft, as assessed on magnetic resonance imaging scan, and a low OAS were significantly associated with a poor Lysholm score and failure. A total of 3 patients had treatment failure, with 1 requiring total knee replacement at 5 years (Lysholm score of 33 at failure) and the other 2 requiring further surgical intervention because of persistent symptoms at 2 and 4 years, respectively (both had Lysholm score of 45 at failure). The Lysholm score in these patients before failure were still noted to be higher than at the preoperative level. Conclusion - The OsPlug technique shows significant improvement of functional outcome for up to 5 years in patients with high-grade osteochondritis dissecans or osteochondral defect. This is the first report describing association of bone graft integration with functional outcome after such a procedure. It also demonstrates histologic evidence of integration of the repair cartilage with the underlying bone graft.","tags":["autologous chondrocyte implantation","Knee","osteochondral defects","osteochondritis dissecans"],"title":"Autologous Bone Plug Supplemented With Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation in Osteochondral Defects of the Knee","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sarah A.

However, as time progresses, NP cells supplemented with serum recover with minimal evidence of cell death. Human NP cells show no evidence of proliferation in response to nutrient supplementation, whereas MSCs showed greater response to increased nutrition. When specifically inducing NP cell death with hydrogen peroxide and staurosporine, as expected, the cell number declined.

Design - Twenty-three patients underwent ACI for chondral defects of either the ankle or the hip.

Prior to chondral harvest, no patient had sought treatment for their knee. Lysholm knee scores were completed prior to chondral harvest and annually post-ACI. Histological analyses of the donor site were performed at 12.3 ± 1.5 months for 3 additional patients who had previously had ACI of the knee. Results - The median preoperative Lysholm score was 100, with no significant differences observed at either 13.7±1.7 months or 4.8±1.8 years postharvest (median Lysholm scores 91.7 and 87.5, respectively). Patients whose cartilage was harvested from the central or medial trochlea had a significantly higher median Lysholm score at latest follow-up (97.9 and 93.4, respectively), compared with those taken from the intercondylar notch (median Lysholm score 66.7). The mean International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) II histological score for the biopsies taken from the donor site of 3 additional knee ACI patients was 117 ± 10 (maximum score 140). Conclusions - This study suggests that the chondral harvest site in ACI is not associated with significant joint morbidity, at least up to 5 years postharvest. However, one should carefully consider the location for chondral harvest as this has been shown to affect knee function in the longer term.","tags":["autologous chondrocyte implantation","Cartilage repair","donor-site morbidity","Histology","osteoarthritis"],"title":"Evaluating Joint Morbidity after Chondral Harvest for Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (ACI): A Study of ACI-Treated Ankles and Hips with a Knee Chondral Harvest","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nupur Kohli","Karina Wright","Rachel L.

Here we report that human MSC-conditioned medium (n=3 donors) significantly increased EaHy-926 endothelial cell adhesion and cell migration, but that this stimulatory effect was markedly donor-dependent. MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry demonstrated that whilst collagen type I and fibronectin were secreted by all of the MSC cultures, the small leucine rich proteoglycan, decorin was secreted only by the MSC culture that was least effective upon EaHy-926 cells. These individual extracellular matrix components were then tested as culture substrata. EaHy-926 cell adherence was greatest on fibronectin-coated surfaces with least adherence on decorin-coated surfaces. Scratch wound assays were used to examine cell migration. EaHy-926 cell scratch wound closure was quickest on substrates of fibronectin and slowest on decorin. However, EaHy-926 cell migration was stimulated by the addition of MSC-conditioned medium irrespective of the types of culture substrates. These data suggest that whilst the MSC secretome may generally be considered angiogenic, the composition of the secretome is variable and this variation probably contributes to donor-donor differences in activity. Hence, screening and optimizing MSC secretomes will improve the clinical effectiveness of pro-angiogenic MSC-based therapies.","tags":["Angiogenesis","Endothelial cells","Mesenchymal stem cells","Secretome"],"title":"Human mesenchymal stem cells stimulate EaHy926 endothelial cell migration: combined proteomic and in vitro analysis of the influence of donor-donor variability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sally Roberts","Helena Evans","Karina Wright","Louw van Niekerk","Bruce Caterson","James B Richardson","Karadi Hari Sunil Kumar","Jan Herman Kuiper"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\r","date":1432166400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647348266,"objectID":"bb4bbb26c34169c98df6593793748cb1","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/adamts-4-activity-in-synovial-fluid-as-a-biomarker-of-inflammation-and-effusion/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/adamts-4-activity-in-synovial-fluid-as-a-biomarker-of-inflammation-and-effusion/","section":"publication","summary":"Objective - To evaluate the potential of ADAMTS-4 (aggrecanase -1) activity in synovial fluid (SF) as a biomarker of knee injury and joint disease.

Specifically, the angiogenic and neurogenic properties of these cells make them attractive for the repair of vascularised and innervated tissues. In this study, we investigate the effect of mesenchymal stem cell conditioned media on in vitro assays of angiogenesis and nerve growth. We describe the use of two state of the art high content and high throughput cell analysis systems and compare them against manual analysis techniques. Mesenchymal stem cell secretomes stimulated angiogenesis and nerve growth in vitro in a donor dependant manner. Levels of neuroregulin, platelet-derived growth factor-AA and glial-derived neurotrophic factor, positively correlated with the observed angiogenic effects of these cells.

The mechanisms responsible for these improvements are still unclear. Purpose - To characterize spinal cord motor neurite interactions with human bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) in an in vitro model of spinal cord injury (SCI). Study design/setting - Previously, we have reported that human MSCs promote the growth of extending sensory neurites from dorsal root ganglia (DRG), in the presence of some of the molecules present in the glial scar, which are attributed with inhibiting axonal regeneration after SCI. We have adapted and optimized this system replacing the DRG with a spinal cord culture to produce a central nervous system (CNS) model, which is more relevant to the SCI situation. Methods - We have developed and characterized a novel spinal cord culture system. Human MSCs were cocultured with spinal motor neurites in substrate choice assays containing glial scar–associated inhibitors of nerve growth. In separate experiments, MSC-conditioned media were analyzed and added to spinal motor neurites in substrate choice assays. Results - As has been reported previously with DRG, substrate-bound neurocan and Nogo-A repelled spinal neuronal adhesion and neurite outgrowth, but these inhibitory effects were abrogated in MSC/spinal cord cocultures. However, unlike DRG, spinal neuronal bodies and neurites showed no inhibition to substrates of myelin-associated glycoprotein. In addition, the MSC secretome contained numerous neurotrophic factors that stimulated spinal neurite outgrowth, but these were not sufficient stimuli to promote spinal neurite extension over inhibitory concentrations of neurocan or Nogo-A. Conclusions - These findings provide novel insight into how MSC transplantation may promote regeneration and functional recovery in animal models of SCI and in the clinic, especially in the chronic situation in which glial scars (and associated neural inhibitors) are well established. In addition, we have confirmed that this CNS model predominantly comprises motor neurons via immunocytochemical characterization. We hope that this model may be used in future research to test various other potential interventions for spinal injury or disease states.","tags":["Bone marrow stromal cells","Spinal motor neurites","Glial scar nerve inhibitors","Spinal cord injury","Secretome","In vitro modelling"],"title":"Spinal motor neurite outgrowth over glial scar inhibitors is enhanced by coculture with bone marrow stromal cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oksana Kehoe","Alison Cartwright","Ayman Askari","Alicia J El Haj","Jim Middleton"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\r","date":1401753600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647863728,"objectID":"563b33578f2b4d2eef51ed5f2ec60adc","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/intra-articular-injection-of-mesenchymal-stem-cells-leads-to-reduced-inflammation-and-cartilage-damage-in-murine-antigen-induced-arthritis/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/intra-articular-injection-of-mesenchymal-stem-cells-leads-to-reduced-inflammation-and-cartilage-damage-in-murine-antigen-induced-arthritis/","section":"publication","summary":"Background - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a debilitating and painful disease leading to increased morbidity and mortality and novel therapeutic approaches are needed. The purpose of this study was to elucidate if mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) injected in the joints of mice with arthritis are therapeutic, reducing joint swelling and cartilage destruction. Methods - Murine mesenchymal stem cells (mMSCs) were isolated from bone marrow of C57Bl/6 mice and expanded in culture. Cells were tested for immunophenotype and their ability to form colonies and to differentiate into chondrocytes, osteocytes and adipocytes. Antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) was induced by intra-articular injection of methylated bovine serum albumin into the knee joints of preimmunized C57Bl/6 mice. After one day, when peak swelling occurs, 500,000 mMSCs labelled with red fluorescent cell tracker CM-DiI were injected intra-articularly in the right knee joint. Left knee joints were treated as controls by receiving PBS injections. Differences between groups were calculated by Mann Whitney U test or unpaired t tests using GraphPad Prism software version 5. Results - Knee joint diameter (swelling) was measured as a clinical indication of joint inflammation and this parameter was significantly less in MSC-treated mice compared to control-treated animals 48 hours after arthritis induction. This difference continued for ~7 days. CM-DiI-labelled MSCs were clearly visualised in the lining and sublining layers of synovium, in the region of the patella and femoral and tibial surfaces. By day 3, parameters indicative of disease severity, including cartilage depletion, inflammatory exudate and arthritic index were shown to be significantly reduced in MSC-treated animals. This difference continued for 7 days and was further confirmed by histological analysis. The serum concentration of tumour necrosis factor α was significantly decreased following MSC administration. Conclusions - Our results reveal that MSCs injected in the joints of mice with AIA are therapeutic, reducing inflammation, joint swelling and cartilage destruction. These cells also integrate into the synovium in AIA.","tags":["Rheumatoid Arthritis","Mesenchymal stem cells","Knee"],"title":"Intra-articular injection of mesenchymal stem cells leads to reduced inflammation and cartilage damage in murine antigen-induced arthritis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Helen McCarthy","Sally Roberts"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\r","date":1384732800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646734196,"objectID":"bc0e37a7344d61b5c532e5cb39874ff8","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/a-histological-comparison-of-the-repair-tissue-formed-when-using-either-chondrogide-or-periosteum-during-autologous-chondrocyte-implantation/","publishdate":"2013-03-08T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/a-histological-comparison-of-the-repair-tissue-formed-when-using-either-chondrogide-or-periosteum-during-autologous-chondrocyte-implantation/","section":"publication","summary":"Objective - In this study, we compare the clinical and histological outcome between periosteum and Chondrogide(®) during autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). Method - This study consisted of 88 patients having received ACI in the knee; 33 treated with Chondrogide(®) (ACI-C) and 55 with periosteum (ACI-P). Post-operative biopsies were taken at a mean of 16.6 ± 8 months (range 7-37 months) and 19 ± 18.4 months (range 4-114) for ACI-C and ACI-P respectively. Histological assessment was performed using the ICRS II and OsScore scoring systems. The immunolocalisation of elastin and collagen types I and II was analysed using specific antibodies. Lysholm scores, a measure of knee function, were obtained pre- and post-operatively at the time of biopsy and annually thereafter. Results - Compared with ACI-P, the repair tissue formed from patients treated with ACI-C demonstrated a significantly higher score for cellular morphology (ICRS II score), significantly better surface morphology from medial femoral condyle treated defects (ICRS II score) and a significantly higher proportion of hyaline cartilage formation (OsScore). Elastin fibres were present in both ACI-C and ACI-P samples, although their presence was very variable in quantity, distribution, orientation, thickness and length. Patients treated with ACI-C demonstrated significantly more collagen type II immunolocalisation compared with ACI-P. Both groups exhibited a significant increase in Lysholm score post-ACI. Conclusions - This study demonstrates a significantly better quality of repair tissue formed with ACI-C compared with ACI-P. Hence Chondrogide(®) is perhaps a better alternative to periosteum during ACI.","tags":["Autologous chondrocyte implantation","Cartilage repair","Chondrogide(®)","Histology","Periosteum"],"title":"A histological comparison of the repair tissue formed when using either Chondrogide(®) or periosteum during autologous chondrocyte implantation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ka-Po Lam","Katy Dempsey","Smith WA","Karina Wright","Wagih EI Masri","James Richardson"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\r","date":1383868800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647352755,"objectID":"fa8d1da27d542bfb1e81446a039f8692","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/a-computational-approach-to-quantifying-axon-regeneration-in-the-presence-of-mesenchymal-stem-cells-mscs/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/a-computational-approach-to-quantifying-axon-regeneration-in-the-presence-of-mesenchymal-stem-cells-mscs/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper demonstrates the use of quantitative live cell imaging techniques for assessing the quality of stem cell cultures.

Results - ACI repair tissue appeared fibrocartilaginous, and ACI repair cells were heterogeneous in morphology and size when freshly isolated, becoming more homogeneous, resembling chondrocytes from adjacent cartilage, after culture expansion. The same weight of ACI repair tissue resulted in less cells than macroscopically normal cartilage. During expansion, ACI repair cells proliferated faster than MSCs but slower than chondrocytes. ACI repair cell immunoprofiles resembled chondrocytes, but their differentiation capacity matched MSCs.

A non-invasive means of assessing cell integration and bio-distribution is fundamental in evaluating the risks and success of this therapy, thereby enabling clinical translation. This paper defines the use of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to image and track MSCs in vivo within a murine model of RA. Methods - Murine MSCs (mMSCs) were isolated, expanded and labelled with SiMAG, a commercially available particle. In vitro MRI visibility thresholds were investigated by labelling mMSCs with SiMAG with concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 μg/ml and resuspending varying cell doses (103 to 5 × 105 cells) in 2 mg/ml collagen prior to MR-imaging. Similarly, in vivo detection thresholds were identified by implanting 3 × 105 mMSCs labelled with 0 to 10 μg/ml SiMAG within the synovial cavity of a mouse and MR-imaging. Upon RA induction, 300,000 mMSCs labelled with SiMAG (10 μg/ml) were implanted via intra-articular injection and joint swelling monitored as an indication of RA development over seven days. Furthermore, the effect of SiMAG on cell viability, proliferation and differentiation was investigated. Results - A minimum particle concentration of 1 μg/ml (300,000 cells) and cell dose of 100,000 cells (5 and 10 μg/ml) were identified as the in vitro MRI detection threshold.

The present study seeks to develop methodology to identify collagen type and other tissue components using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectral evaluation of matrix composition in combination with multivariate analyses. FTIR spectra of the primary molecular components of repair cartilage, types I and II collagen, and aggrecan, were used to develop multivariate spectral models for discrimination of the matrix components of the tissues of interest. Infrared imaging data were collected from bovine bone, tendon, normal cartilage, meniscus and human repair cartilage tissues, and composition predicted using partial least squares analyses. Histology and immunohistochemistry results were used as standards for validation. Infrared fiber optic probe spectral data were also obtained from meniscus (a tissue with mixed collagen types) to evaluate the potential of this method for identification of collagen type in a minimally-invasive clinical application. Concentration profiles of the tissue components obtained from multivariate analysis were in excellent agreement with histology and immunohistochemistry results. Bone and tendon showed a uniform distribution of predominantly type I collagen through the tissue. Normal cartilage showed a distribution of type II collagen and proteoglycan similar to the known composition, while in repair cartilage, the spectral distribution of both types I and II collagen were similar to that observed via immunohistochemistry. Using the probe, the outer and inner regions of the meniscus were shown to be primarily composed of type I and II collagen, respectively, in accordance with immunohistochemistry data. In summary, multivariate analysis of infrared spectra can indeed be used to differentiate collagen type I and type II, even in the presence of proteoglycan, in connective tissues, using both imaging and fiber optic methodology. This has great potential for clinical in situ applications for monitoring tissue repair.","tags":[],"title":"Fourier transform infrared imaging and infrared fiber optic probe spectroscopy identify collagen type in connective tissues","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ben Johnson","Caroline Lever","Sally Roberts","James Richardson","Helen McCarthy","Paul Harrison","Patrick Laing","Nilesh Makwana"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\r","date":1362700800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646733116,"objectID":"ae8723bfea21dcf766b427a392ae3448","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/cell-cultured-chondrocyte-implantation-and-scaffold-techniques-for-osteochondral-talar-lesions/","publishdate":"2013-03-08T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cell-cultured-chondrocyte-implantation-and-scaffold-techniques-for-osteochondral-talar-lesions/","section":"publication","summary":"Cell cultured techniques have gained interest and popularity in osteochondral defects because, unlike bone marrow stimulation methods, where fibrocartilage fills the defect, they allow for the regeneration of 'hyaline-like cartilage' with better stiffness, resilience, and wear characteristics.

In this study, CXCL8, an inflammatory chemokine, was shown to induce the formation of filopodia-like protrusions on endothelial cells; the same effects were observed with CXCL10 and CCL5. Chemokines stimulated filopodia formation by both microvascular (from bone marrow and skin) and macrovascular (from human umbilical vein) endothelial cells. Use of blocking Abs and degradative enzymes demonstrated that CXCL8-stimulated filopodia formation was mediated by CXCR1 and CXCR2, Duffy Ag/receptor for chemokines, heparan sulfate (HS), and syndecans. HS was present on filopodial protrusions appearing as a meshwork on the cell surface, which colocalized with CXCL8, and this glycosaminoglycan was 2,6-O- and 3-O-sulfated. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that CXCL8-stimulated filopodial and microvilli-like protrusions that interacted with leukocytes before transendothelial migration and removal of HS reduced this migration. iTRAQ mass spectrometry showed that changes in the levels of cytoskeletal, signaling, and extracellular matrix proteins were associated with CXCL8-stimulated filopodia/microvilli formation; these included tropomyosin, fascin, and Rab7. This study suggests that chemokines stimulate endothelial filopodia and microvilli formation, leading to their presentation to leukocytes and leukocyte transendothelial migration.","tags":[],"title":"A chemokine self-presentation mechanism involving formation of endothelial surface microstructures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Helen McCarthy","Jos Malda","James Richardson","Sally Roberts"],"categories":[],"content":"\r\r\r\r\rtitle: Increased Production of Clusterin in Biopsies of Repair Tissue following Autologous\rChondrocyte Implantation\rauthor: anais\rdate: ‘2013-02-12’\rslug: increased-production-of-clusterin-in-biopsies-of-repair-tissue-following-autologous-chondrocyte-implantation\rcategories: []\rtags: []\rsubtitle: ’’\rsummary: ’’\rauthors: [“Helen McCarthy”,“Jos Malda”,“James Richardson”,“Sally Roberts”]\rlastmod: ‘2022-03-07T16:22:28Z’\rfeatured: no\rimage:\rcaption: ’’\rfocal_point: ’’\rpreview_only: no\rprojects: []\rdoi: “10.1177/1947603513477652”\rpublishDate: 2009-07-04T15:53:28.000Z\rurl_pdf: “https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1947603513477652”\rpublication_types:\r- ‘2’\rpublication: ‘Cartilage’\rpublication_short: ’’\rabstract: “Objective - To characterize the immunolocalization of clusterin in the repair cartilage of patients having undergone autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) and evaluate correlation to clinical outcome.\r\rDesign - Full-depth core biopsies of repair tissue were obtained from 38 patients who had undergone ACI at an average of 18 ± 13 months previously (range 8-67 months).

Identification of molecules involved in monocyte/macrophage recruitment in inflammation is crucial for development of therapeutic interventions. Chemokine receptor CCR9 is up-regulated on these cells in peripheral blood and synovium of rheumatoid patients. This study investigated the course of antigen-induced arthritis in CCR9 deficient C57BL/6 mice in comparison to wild type animals to determine whether CCR9 is critical for disease severity and progression. Methods - Methylated bovine serum albumin was used for induction of uni-lateral arthritis by direct injection into the knee joints of preimmunized animals. Arthritis is confined to the injected joint allowing comparison with the normal opposing joint. Clinical severity of arthritis was assessed by measuring swelling in the arthritic joint in comparison to the normal joint. Histological analysis was performed to assess the extent of leukocyte infiltration and cartilage depletion. Results - Levels of swelling were not significantly different between wild type and CCR9 deficient mice. Similarly there was no significant difference in histological severity of arthritis when comparing CCR9-deficient mice to wild type mice. Conclusions - CCR9 was not required for development of synovial inflammation and cartilage destruction in the anti-gen-induced model of arthritis in C57BL/6 mice in this study. This may reflect a true lack of a pathogenic role of CCR9 on monocyte/macrophage function in vivo or it may reflect differences in the current antigen-induced arthritis model when compared to human RA.","tags":["Chemokine Receptor CCR9","Rheumatoid Arthritis","Inflammation","Antigen-Induced Arthritis","Animal model","Monocytes/Macrophages"],"title":"Is Chemokine Receptor CCR9 Required for Synovitis in Rheumatoid Arthritis?

However, the precise mechanisms through which transplanted MSC attenuate inflammation after SCI are still unclear. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of MSC transplantation with a special focus on their effect on macrophage activation after SCI. Rats were subjected to T9–T10 SCI by contusion, then treated 3 days later with transplantation of 1.0×106 PKH26-labeled MSC into the contusion epicenter. The transplanted MSC migrated within the injured spinal cord without differentiating into glial or neuronal elements. MSC transplantation was associated with marked changes in the SCI environment, with significant increases in IL-4 and IL-13 levels, and reductions in TNF-α and IL-6 levels. This was associated simultaneously with increased numbers of alternatively activated macrophages (M2 phenotype: arginase-1- or CD206-positive), and decreased numbers of classically activated macrophages (M1 phenotype: iNOS- or CD16/32-positive). These changes were associated with functional locomotion recovery in the MSC-transplanted group, which correlated with preserved axons, less scar tissue formation, and increased myelin sparing. Our results suggested that acute transplantation of MSC after SCI modified the inflammatory environment by shifting the macrophage phenotype from M1 to M2, and that this may reduce the effects of the inhibitory scar tissue in the subacute/chronic phase after injury to provide a permissive environment for axonal extension and functional recovery.","tags":[],"title":"Transplantation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Promotes an Alternative Pathway of Macrophage Activation and Functional Recovery after Spinal Cord Injury","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karina Wright","Wagih El Masri","Aheed Osman","Joy Chowdhury","William E.

We have immobilised recombinant Nm23H1 proteins to defined locations of culture plates, which were then seeded with explants of embryonic chick dorsal root ganglia (DRG) or dissociated adult rat DRG neurons. The substratum-bound extracellular Nm23H1 was stimulatory for neurite outgrowth from chick DRG explants in a concentration-dependent manner. On high concentrations of Nm23H1, chick DRG neurite outgrowth was extensive and effectively limited to the location of the Nm23H1, i.e. neuronal growth cones turned away from adjacent collagen-coated substrata. Nm23H1-coated substrata also significantly enhanced rat DRG neuronal cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth in comparison to collagen-coated substrata. These effects were independent of NGF supplementation. Recombinant Nm23H1 (H118F), which does not possess NDP kinase activity, exhibited the same activity as the wild-type protein. Hence, a novel neuro-stimulatory activity for extracellular Nm23H1 has been identified in vitro, which may function in developing neuronal systems.","tags":["Nm23H1","Nerve growth","Nucleoside diphosphate kinase","Extracellular activity"],"title":"Extracellular Nm23H1 stimulates neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglia neurons in vitro independently of nerve growth factor supplementation or its nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karina Wright","Gareth J.

These analyses were compared to previously published methods that involved hand-tracing individual neurites. Both methods demonstrated that MSC-CM promoted neurite outgrowth. Each showed the proportion of SH-SY5Y cells with neurites increased by ~200% in MSC-CM within 48 h, and the number of neurites/SH-SY5Y cells was significantly increased in MSC-CM compared with control medium. For high-content screening, the analysis was performed within minutes, testing multiple samples of MSC-CM and in each case measuring 15,000 SH-SY5Y cells. In contrast, the manual measurement of neurite outgrowth from 200 SH-SY5Y cells in a single sample of MSC-CM took at least 1 h. High-content analysis provided additional measures of increased neurite branching in MSC-CM compared with control medium. MSC-CM was also found to stimulate neurite outgrowth in DRG explants using either method.

Both in serum supplemented and serum free conditions, wound closure was faster in L929 fibroblast than HaCaT keratinocyte scratch assays, and in co-culture the L929 fibroblasts lead the way in closing the scratches. MSC-CM generated under serum free conditions significantly enhanced the wound closure rate of both skin cell types separately and in co-culture, whereas conditioned medium from L929 or HaCaT cultures had no significant effect. This enhancement of wound closure in the presence of MSC-CM was due to accelerated cell migration rather than increased cell proliferation. A number of wound healing mediators were identified in MSC-CM, including TGF-β1, the chemokines IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and RANTES, and collagen type I, fibronectin, SPARC and IGFBP-7.

Atrophic fracture non unions have been described as the most difficult to treat and this is thought to arise through a cellular and local failure of osteogenesis. However, little is known about the presence and osteogenic proficiency of cells in the local area of non union tissue. We have examined the growth and differentiation potential of cells isolated from human non union tissues compared with normal human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSC). We report the isolation and culture expansion of a population of non union stromal cells (NUSC) which have a CD profile similar to that of BMSC, i.e. CD34-ve, CD45-ve and CD105+ve. The NUSC demonstrated multipotentiality and differentiated to some extent along chondrogenic, adipogenic and osteogenic lineages. However, and importantly, the NUSC showed significantly reduced osteogenic differentiation and mineralization in vitro compared to BMSC. We also found increased levels of cell senescence in NUSC compared to BMSC based on culture growth kinetics and cell positivity for senescence associated beta galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) activity. The reduced capacity of NUSC to form osteoblasts was associated with significantly elevated secretion of Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1) which is an important inhibitor of Wnt signalling during osteogenesis, compared to BMSC. Conversely, treating BMSC with levels of rhDkk-1 that were equivalent to those levels secreted by NUSC inhibited the capacity of BMSC to undergo osteogenesis. Treating BMSC with NUSC conditioned medium also inhibited the capacity of the BMSC to undergo osteogenic differentiation when compared to their treatment with BMSC conditioned medium. Our results suggest that the development of fracture non union is linked with a localised reduced capacity of cells to undergo osteogenesis, which in turn is associated with increased cell senescence and Dkk-1 secretion.","tags":["Fracture non union","Non union stromal cells","Differentiation","Cell senescence","Dkk-1"],"title":"Decreased osteogenesis, increased cell senescence and elevated Dickkopf-1 secretion in human fracture non union stromal cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oksana Kehoe","Neena Kalia","Sophie King","Andrew Eustace","Charlotte Boyes","Ofer Reizes","Anwen Williams","Angela Patterson","Jim Middleton"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\r","date":1246722808,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647864139,"objectID":"a8899334cf53bdc31c7ccf0bdd75fca9","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/syndecan-3-is-selectively-pro-inflammatory-in-the-joint-and-contributes-to-antigen-induced-arthritis-in-mice/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/syndecan-3-is-selectively-pro-inflammatory-in-the-joint-and-contributes-to-antigen-induced-arthritis-in-mice/","section":"publication","summary":"Introduction - Syndecans are heparan sulphate proteoglycans expressed by endothelial cells. Syndecan-3 is expressed by synovial endothelial cells of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients where it binds chemokines, suggesting a role in leukocyte trafficking. The objective of the current study was to examine the function of syndecan-3 in joint inflammation by genetic deletion in mice and compare with other tissues. Methods - Chemokine C-X-C ligand 1 (CXCL1) was injected in the joints of syndecan-3−/−and wild-type mice and antigen-induced arthritis performed. For comparison chemokine was administered in the skin and cremaster muscle. Intravital microscopy was performed in the cremaster muscle. Results - Administration of CXCL1 in knee joints of syndecan-3−/−mice resulted in reduced neutrophil accumulation compared to wild type. This was associated with diminished presence of CXCL1 at the luminal surface of synovial endothelial cells where this chemokine clustered and bound to heparan sulphate. Furthermore, in the arthritis model syndecan-3 deletion led to reduced joint swelling, leukocyte accumulation, cartilage degradation and overall disease severity. Conversely, CXCL1 administration in the skin of syndecan-3 null mice provoked increased neutrophil recruitment and was associated with elevated luminal expression of E-selectin by dermal endothelial cells. Similarly in the cremaster, intravital microscopy showed increased numbers of leukocytes adhering and rolling in venules in syndecan-3−/−mice in response to CXCL1 or tumour necrosis factor alpha. Conclusions - This study shows a novel role for syndecan-3 in inflammation. In the joint it is selectively pro-inflammatory, functioning in endothelial chemokine presentation and leukocyte recruitment and cartilage damage in an RA model. Conversely, in skin and cremaster it is anti-inflammatory.","tags":["Rheumatoid Arthritis","Syndecan-3","Animal model"],"title":"Syndecan-3 is selectively pro-inflammatory in the joint and contributes to antigen-induced arthritis in mice","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Marshall","Sally Evans","Christopher Sharp","Diane Powell","Helen McCarthy","Michael Davie"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\r","date":1246665600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646667236,"objectID":"808e8f18992aea914465c7dc8536c17f","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/increased-circulating-dickkopf-1-in-paget-s-disease-of-bone/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/increased-circulating-dickkopf-1-in-paget-s-disease-of-bone/","section":"publication","summary":"Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1) is a secreted inhibitor of Wnt signaling which in adults regulates bone turnover.

The importance of PDGF in fracture healing suggests a role for OPG production in countering bone resorption during the early phase of this process.","tags":[],"title":"Platelet-derived growth factor stimulates osteoprotegerin production in osteoblastic cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giselle Chamberlain","Karina Wright","Antal Rot","Brian Ashton","Jim Middleton"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\r","date":1218585600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647431903,"objectID":"fecb0b6cf3e090b9a4f05fb063a97051","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/murine-mesenchymal-stem-cells-exhibit-a-restricted-repertoire-of-functional-chemokine-receptors-comparison-with-human/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/murine-mesenchymal-stem-cells-exhibit-a-restricted-repertoire-of-functional-chemokine-receptors-comparison-with-human/","section":"publication","summary":"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are non-haematopoeitic, stromal cells that are capable of differentiating into mesenchymal tissues such as bone and cartilage. They are rare in bone marrow, but have the ability to expand many-fold in culture, and retain their growth and multi-lineage potential. The properties of MSCs make them ideal candidates for tissue engineering. It has been shown that MSCs, when transplanted systemically, can home to sites of injury, suggesting that MSCs possess migratory capacity; however, mechanisms underlying migration of these cells remain unclear. Chemokine receptors and their ligands play an important role in tissue-specific homing of leukocytes. Here we define the cell surface chemokine receptor repertoire of murine MSCs from bone marrow, with a view to determining their migratory activity. We also define the chemokine receptor repertoire of human MSCs from bone marrow as a comparison. We isolated murine MSCs from the long bones of Balb/c mice by density gradient centrifugation and adherent cell culture. Human MSCs were isolated from the bone marrow of patients undergoing hip replacement by density gradient centrifugation and adherent cell culture. The expression of chemokine receptors on the surface of MSCs was studied using flow cytometry. Primary murine MSCs expressed CCR6, CCR9, CXCR3 and CXCR6 on a large proportion of cells (73±11%, 44±25%, 55±18% and 96±2% respectively). Chemotaxis assays were used to verify functionality of these chemokine receptors. We have also demonstrated expression of these receptors on human MSCs, revealing some similarity in chemokine receptor expression between the two species. Consequently, these murine MSCs would be a useful model to further study the role of chemokine receptors in in vivo models of disease and injury, for example in recruitment of MSCs to inflamed tissues for repair or immunosupression.","tags":["Mesenchymal stem cells","Bone marrow","Chemokine"],"title":"Murine Mesenchymal Stem Cells Exhibit a Restricted Repertoire of Functional Chemokine Receptors: Comparison with Human","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karina Wright","Wagih EI Masri","Aheed Osman","Sally Roberts","Jayesh Trivedi","Brian A.

Here, we have examined the growth in cell culture of MSCs isolated from individuals with SCI, compared with non-SCI donors. Setting - Centre for Spinal Studies, Midland Centre for Spinal Injuries, RJAH Orthopaedic Hospital, Oswestry, UK. Methods - Bone marrow was harvested from the iliac crest of donors with long-term SCI (3 months, n=9) or from non-SCI donors (n=7). Mononuclear cells were plated out into tissue culture flasks and the adherent MSC population subsequently expanded in monolayer culture. MSC were passaged by trypsinization at 70% confluence and routinely seeded into new flasks at a density of 5 × 103 cells per cm2. Expanded cell cultures were phenotypically characterized by CD-immunoprofiling and by their differentiation potential along chondrocyte, osteoblast and adipocyte lineages. The influence of cell-seeding density on the rate of cell culture expansion and degree of cell senescence was examined in separate experiments. Results - In SCI, but not in non-SCI donors the number of adherent cells harvested at passage I was age-related. The proliferation rate (culture doubling times) between passages I and II was significantly greater in cultures from SCI donors with cervical lesions than in those with thoracic lesions. There was no significant difference, however, in either the overall cell harvests at passages I or II or in the culture doubling times between SCI and non-SCI donors. At passage II, more than 95% of cells were CD34−ve, CD45−ve and CD105+ve, which is characteristic of human MSC cultures. Furthermore, passage II cells differentiated along all three mesenchymal lineages tested. Seeding passage I–III cells at cell densities lower than 5 × 103 cells per cm2 significantly reduced culture doubling times and significantly increased overall cell harvests while having no effect on cell senescence. Conclusion - MSCs from individuals with SCI can be successfully isolated and expanded in culture; this is encouraging for the future development of MSC transplantation therapies to treat SCI. Age, level of spinal injury and cell-seeding density were all found to relate to the growth kinetics of MSC cultures in vitro, albeit in a small sample group. Therefore, these factors should be considered if either the overall number or the timing of MSC transplantations post-injury is found to relate to functional recovery.","tags":["Spinal cord injury","Cell transplantation","Bone marrow stromal cells","Cell proliferation"],"title":"The cell culture expansion of bone marrow stromal cells from humans with spinal cord injury: implications for future cell transplantation therapy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jun Cai","Oksana Kehoe","Gill M Smith","Philip Hykin","Michael E Boulton"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\r","date":1209600000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647867129,"objectID":"6fc30e16550dfce4eece1c6907007217","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/the-angiopoietin-tie-2-system-regulates-pericyte-survival-and-recruitment-in-diabetic-retinopathy/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/the-angiopoietin-tie-2-system-regulates-pericyte-survival-and-recruitment-in-diabetic-retinopathy/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose - The angiopoietin (Ang) system plays an important role in vascular stabilization and pathologic neovascularization.

How these improvements come about is currently unclear. We have examined the interaction of MSC with neurons, using an established in vitro model of nerve growth, in the presence of substrate-bound extracellular molecules that are thought to inhibit axonal regeneration, i.e., neural proteoglycans (CSPG), myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) and Nogo-A. Each of these molecules repelled neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in a concentration-dependent manner. However, these nerve-inhibitory effects were much reduced in MSC/DRG co-cultures. Video microscopy demonstrated that MSC acted as “cellular bridges” and also “towed” neurites over the nerve-inhibitory substrates. Whereas conditioned medium from MSC cultures stimulated DRG neurite outgrowth over type I collagen, it did not promote outgrowth over CSPG, MAG or Nogo-A. These findings suggest that MSC transplantation may promote axonal regeneration both by stimulating nerve growth via secreted factors and also by reducing the nerve-inhibitory effects of the extracellular molecules present.","tags":["Bone marrow stromal cells","Spinal cord injury","Cell transplantation","CSPG","Myelin inhibitors","Neurite outgrowth"],"title":"Bone marrow stromal cells stimulate neurite outgrowth over neural proteoglycans (CSPG), myelin associated glycoprotein and Nogo-A","type":"publication"},{"authors":["William E B Johnson","Sarit Sivan","Karina Wright","Stephen M Eisenstein","Alice Maroudas","Sally Roberts"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\r","date":1147651200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647435857,"objectID":"9128def8e822fad9671c50d4f8051f44","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/human-intervertebral-disc-cells-promote-nerve-growth-over-substrata-of-human-intervertebral-disc-aggrecan/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/human-intervertebral-disc-cells-promote-nerve-growth-over-substrata-of-human-intervertebral-disc-aggrecan/","section":"publication","summary":"Study Design - Coculture assays of the migration and interaction of human intervertebral disc cells and chick sensory nerves on alternate substrata of collagen and aggrecan. Objective - To examine the effects of aggrecan on disc cell migration, how disc cells and sensory nerves interact, and whether disc cells affect previously reported inhibitory effects of aggrecan on sensory nerve growth. Summary of Background Data - Human intervertebral disc aggrecan is inhibitory to sensory nerve growth in vitro, suggesting that a loss of aggrecan from the disc may have a role in the increased innervation seen in disc degeneration. Endothelial cells that appear to co-migrate with nerves into degenerated intervertebral disc express neurotrophic factors, but the effects of disc cells on nerve growth are not known. Methods - Human disc cells were seeded onto tissue culture plates that had been coated with type I collagen and human intervertebral disc aggrecan. Explants of chick dorsal root ganglions (DRGs) were subsequently added to the plates and sensory neurite outgrowth stimulated by the addition of nerve growth factor. Time-lapse video and fluorescence microscopy were used to examine the migration and interaction of the disc cells and sensory neurites, in the context of the different matrix substrata. The effects of disc cell conditioned medium on nerve growth were also examined. Results - Disc cells spread and migrated on collagen until they encountered the aggrecan substrata, where some cells, but not all, were repelled. In coculture, DRG neurites extended onto the collagen/disc cells until they encountered the aggrecan, where, like the disc cells, many were repelled. However, in the presence of disc cells, some neurites were able to cross onto this normally inhibitory substratum. The number of neurite crossings onto aggrecan correlated significantly with the number of disc cells present on the aggrecan. In control experiments using DRG alone, all extending neurites were repelled at the collagen/aggrecan border. Conditioned medium from disc cell cultures stimulated DRG neurite outgrowth on collagen but did not increase neurite crossing onto aggrecan substrata. Conclusions - Human disc cells migrate across aggrecan substrata that are repellent to sensory DRG neurites. Disc cells synthesize neurotrophic factors in vitro that promote neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, the presence of disc cells in coculture with DRG partially abrogates the inhibitory effects of aggrecan on nerve growth. These findings have important implications for the regulation of nerve growth into the intervertebral disc, but whether disc cells promote nerve growth in vivo remains to be determined.","tags":[],"title":"Human Intervertebral Disc Cells Promote Nerve Growth Over Substrata of Human Intervertebral Disc Aggrecan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oksana Kostyuk","Oksana Kehoe","Turki M Mubard","Justyn W Regini","Keith M Meek","Andrew J Quantock","Gerald F Elliott","Stuart A Hodson"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\r","date":1030838400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647867550,"objectID":"caedb5525efa6fa80af421fbf39d11ea","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/transparency-of-the-bovine-corneal-stroma-at-physiological-hydration-and-its-dependence-on-concentration-of-the-ambient-anion/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/transparency-of-the-bovine-corneal-stroma-at-physiological-hydration-and-its-dependence-on-concentration-of-the-ambient-anion/","section":"publication","summary":"De-epithelialised and de-endothelialised bovine corneal stromas with a hydration of 3.2 equilibrated at 154 mM NaCl and buffered at pH 7.4 had their optical density (400-750 nm) measured. Stromas equilibrated against 10, 20, 30, 50 or 100 mM NaCl made isotonic to 154 mM NaCl by supplementing with sorbitol were progressively more transparent as NaCl increased. Hypertonic equilibration against 300, 600 or 1000 mM NaCl resulted in a progressive loss of transparency compared with 154 mM NaCl. Light scattering as a function of wavelength fitted a lambda(-3) function well for 10, 30, 50, 100 and 154 mM NaCl preparations between 450 and 650 nm, but not at higher wavelengths. However, hypertonic 300, 600 and 1000 mM NaCl preparations showed a lambda(-2) dependence in the 450-750 nm range. Experiments with 154 mM NaCl and either 0 or 300 mM sorbitol suggested that the changes in light scattering in hypertonic preparations are unlikely to be caused by osmotic alterations to the stromal keratocytes. Psychophysical studies of the optical transmission function of preparations indicated that corneal stromas dialysed against 154 mM NaCl had usable optical properties, but preparations dialysed against 10 mM NaCl were effectively unable to transmit an image. The results are related to the known increase of fixed negative charge in the corneal matrix when chloride ions are adsorbed onto the matrix. It is suggested that the ordering force between corneal collagen fibrils, generated in part by anion binding, may be crucial to the physiological functioning of the visual system.","tags":[],"title":"Transparency of the bovine corneal stroma at physiological hydration and its dependence on concentration of the ambient anion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L I Ostapchenko","Oksana Kehoe","N E Kucherenko"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"\r\r","date":928195200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647873327,"objectID":"dd6f65494da54315f218d7e5b003ad58","permalink":"https://oskor.netlify.app/publication/the-use-of-nontraditional-approaches-to-the-analysis-of-the-effects-of-radiation-on-the-system-of-protein-phosphorylation-in-spleen-lymphocytes/","publishdate":"2009-07-04T15:53:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/the-use-of-nontraditional-approaches-to-the-analysis-of-the-effects-of-radiation-on-the-system-of-protein-phosphorylation-in-spleen-lymphocytes/","section":"publication","summary":"Postradiation disturbances in functioning of Ca(2+)- and cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase systems are established.
